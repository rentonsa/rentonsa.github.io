	<h1>Welcome.</h1>
        <p>I'm Scott Renton, a Systems Developer at the University of Edinburgh Library; I work in a small team that deals with repositories and their associated workflows. My main interests are around Special Collections- Musuems items, Archives and Rare Books- and the online discovery thereof. Image management, data integration and working with the IIIF framework are the main things I do, but I get involved in whatever comes the team's way, including scholarly repositories, research data and library catalogue related activities.
