LAGER LOVELIES
==============
Written early 2007, with changes to tune and words running on for years after. Things were at their peak with Uhersky Brod at the time, and I was challenged by David Gordon following a conversation about said ladies (something about "surely a funster like you could come up with a song").Came away with what I felt was a good vocal "riff", but somehow I just couldn't reconcile it, and it petered out after a few performances (at most once with the Brod I think), so it's now a gentle picking song. Coming back to it a decade later, I realised it was horrifically misogynist, so changes have been made [old words in brackets]. Not to rewrite history, the first version had contributions from Dylan Matthews, but it's changed quite a bit since 2007.

 F                        Bb          
The girls from round my parish, 
C                        F
their hopes in life were sparse 
F                        Bb
You'd see them in the bus stop, 
C                    F
or wi their heads in cars 
         Dm             Bb
But if they were really bonny, 
         C               Dm
there'd sometimes be a man 
 F                   Bb
Who'd offer them a future
 C             Dm
On a Tennents can
 F                    Bb
Who'd offer them a future
 C             F
On a Tennents can

The guys around my parish were not a happy crew 
On a good day they got snooker, 
on a bad day they got queue 
There's one very constant 
they'd gather man for man 
And pay to see the darlings 
On their Tennents cans
And pay to see the darlings 
On their Tennents cans

[They kept their virtues hidden
They kept their pleasures chaste
Unlike those seaside biros
In bikini-dropping haste]
Bb
And although they are no bigger 
F 
than my outstretched hand
Bb
To me they're burlesque girls 
C
dancing the can can
F              Bb
Linda, Violet, Tina, Karen,
C             Dm
Ladies take a bow
F                   Bb
You rearranged my drinking
C                   F
Beer tastes different now

When I was just an infant
I'd poke around the bin
And take the last remaining sips
From dad's discarded tins
And then I'd shuffle back to bed
And hatch my evil plan
Of bagging up a lovely
On a Tennent's can
Of bagging up a lovely
On a Tennent's can

If your wife objected you didn't to have think 
You had a readymade
excuse "I buy it for the drink"
[Couldn't do that with the Daily Star
And it shows too much tan]
Inebriated visions
I know you'll understand
The fantasies all printed
On a Tennent's can
The fantasies all printed
On a Tennent's can

And although they are no bigger 
than my outstretched hand
To me they're burlesque girls 
dancing the can can
Linda, Violet, Tina, Karen
Ladies take a bow
You rearranged my drinking
Beer tastes different now

[They're hardly Playboy Playmates
They'd never make Page Three
But a pretty girl and a drink of beer
Is good enough for me
Linda, Karen, Violet, Ann
Ladies take a bow
Penny, Shona, Vicky...
Beer tastes different now]

It fell to one Mark Hunter in 1991
To break it to the brewery board
That this could not go on
And though he knew his mission was
A worthy, just, good plan
He also knew he'd miss'em
On the Tennent's cans
He also knew he'd miss'em
On the Tennent's cans

The world's a duller place now
Without decorated drink
What are those girls doing now
And what do they think? [their fans]
A remnant of a different time 
A time whose course just ran
So I shall toast the lassies
And raise a Tennent's can
So I shall toast the lassies
And raise a Tennent's can
