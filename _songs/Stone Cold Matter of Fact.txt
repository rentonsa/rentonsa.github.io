STONE COLD MATTER OF FACT
=========================
Written March 2019. Used the hook line of 'Never Again' so it wasn't completely lost. The song is about the Daily Mail, basically, fake news etc. It doesn't stand out, although could work developed by The Heartbreak Diet. It includes my most audacious play on words yet.

Key : Bb (capo 3 G shapes)

Ebmaj7                                F                        Bb  
Well it's a matter of fact that there's not enough room for invasion
Ebmaj7            F                          Bb
Tell you the news, I wouldn't play on your fear
Gm                                         F                          Bb
And it's a matter of fact that you there's plenty grounds for invasion
Ebmaj7                                F                        Bb  
If you don't agree then I don't see the point in you here

Well it's a matter of fact that the clever go-getter is king here
He's alright jack, look at him climb watch him strive
And it's a matter of fact that everyone else is just scrounging
And we live in a world where you've gotta be fit to survive

           Gm                    Dm                 Ebmaj7         Bb                   
You run the show, you raise the dead by posting letters to their heads
               Gm                   Ebmaj7         Bb
You play the victim though I can't see what you lack
             Gm                    Dm                 Ebmaj7         Bb    
And I don't know but I've been told that you can't have too much gold
Ebmaj7                                F                        Bb 
And that you're dealing in illusion is a stone cold matter of fact

Well it's a matter of fact if it's not but it's told with conviction
If it's got all the strength of the gutter holding it high
And it's a matter of fact that the righteous all live in the same tent
And that all of the gospel is written under the line

You run the show, you raise the dead by posting letters to their heads
You play the victim though I can't see what you lack
You tell me that I'm more alt-right than you which is just immoral trite and due
To that your dealing in illusion is a stone cold matter of fact
