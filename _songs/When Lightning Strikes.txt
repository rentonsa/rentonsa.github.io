WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES
======================
Written End 2019/early 2020. Idea was to do some gentler songs that didn't fit into HBD or the solo folky stuff; so incongruous I thought Elspeth could sing them. Don't feel they're lyrically very hooky, so wouldn't work with my usual solo stuff. More electric guitar led, with less heavy rhythm (was watching Yo La Tengo when this crossed my mind). Thought I could work up a small collection of disaster songs- all quite depressing. This was originally about my mind after being knocked back for a job! However, it became more about "you only bother about faith when something terrible happens".

Key: D

D
When lightning strikes
And clouds unfold
      Em         G
And boiling springs
          D
Turn bitter cold
D 
When forests burn
And plates collide
      Em         G
And leaning towers
          D
Fall on their sides

G               Em
That's when you'll find me
Bm               D
Banging on your door
G            Em
All of contrition
    D
Dread remorse
G                 Em
That's when I'll bargain
Bm                    D
Raise the stakes some more
G                Em
Hoping you'll throw me
Cmaj7         D
Back on course

It's blackened souls
Hypocrisy
No moral compass
You'll find on me
You judged me well
You got me right
I only seek you out
In sorry plight
