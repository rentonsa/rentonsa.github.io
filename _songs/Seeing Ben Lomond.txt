SEEING BEN LOMOND
=================
Written Dec 2005- same project as Nae Drama (see for more info). I'd had the tune a few months, but it took this to give it words. That is Bert Jansch's Needle Of Death change in there- I hold my hands up. Always takes a bit of explaining when performed, and even when you tell them it's about the old man of the story seeing The Sleeping Warrior and thinking it's Ben Lomond, it doesn't elucidate much. Quite a nice tune though. Wrote the instrumental break in 1997; always trying to find places to put things so they don't get lost.

Recordings: Jim Sutherland, Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod)

Key C: (G shapes on capo 5 to )

C	Am opening

C		                F
Aye, we've been here many years
Am		              F	  G
In Glesga's northern ken
C		                F
Round Ruchill and the Wyndford
Am	                    	F	G
But just a short hop tae Bearsden
F		                   C
And I feel that I've been gifted
F		                G
As ma window I stare through
C		                    F
It lets light in cross the river
G		   F	          C
And ye canny whack the view

Pan across that sunset skyline
Graffiti'd wa's and chimney stacks
Er's the Firhill floodlights, leccy wires
Overhangin' railway tracks
And the spire of St Gregory
And the cranes wi daring men
And somewhere just beyond thae highrises
Lie the mountains, lies ma Ben

Tak a look, appreciate
Peter, Jean and John
That speck on the horizon there
Is what God tell's me I've won
Christ it makes an auld man happy
That's what yeez need tae see
It's ma landscape, it's ma Scotland
It's mother nature, and it's free.
