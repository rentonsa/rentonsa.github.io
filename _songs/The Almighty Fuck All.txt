THE ALMIGHTY FUCK ALL
=====================
Written October 2018. Originally started in 2008 to the hilarious line "I pissed myself...". A sort of country gospel number, with no need for variation in tune (just dynamics, I suppose), it was looking for a home long after I started thinking of it (without words) as The Almighty Fuck All, in 2009. It found a home as the chorus of the HBD version of You Ain't Getting Nowhere, and I would still use the 'She drew me in' chorus as the opening of the flowing version. However, it's now about Scotland's less than equal relationship with Westminster. Last line deliberately ambiguous.

Key: C

C           G            C
A funny kind of distribution
       C      G             C
You pay it in, you get no wealth
     C             G           Am
This Santa Claus empties your stocking
         C                G             C
This Robin Hood cons the poor to feed himself

His Gothic mood, his sturdy shoulders
His flowing beard, his able men
His steel capped boots, his choir of Angels
You'll ken his face fae news at ten (ITN?)

C                  G                  C
You can't have that, you'll no get nothing
C                        G              C
You can't have that, we were only bluffing
      C                G             Am
You ask for pounds, you might get pennies
  C                       G          C
Can I have some more? You'll no get any

What d'ye want fae life? Some kind of future
Be more precise- a legacy?
May I suggest you try mail order
This counter's closed indefinitely

But just take heart- it's cause he's frightened
He fears what comes of leniency
So don't back down, keep undermining
Now's not the time? Just wait and see.

You can't have that, you'll no get nothing
You can't have that, we were only bluffing
Don't cry for pounds, you're getting pennies
And if you want it all, you'll no get any

C              G        C
Oh Lord you can't have that
 C           G           C
Oh Lord you can't have that
C               G                Am
You can't have that yer pounds, yer pennies
C                G              Am
You can't have that you'll no get any
 C                    G                  C
You can't have that? You're few, we're many

I pissed myself I got it wrong
I pissed myself the smell was strong
I pissed myself I didn't mean it
I pissed myself now I gotta clean it
