DESIGN
======
Written in 2006. Slightly forced lyric, in the aftermath of a couple of disasters in the flat. Brought in the "never been to Greece" segment which had been looking for a whom for the preceding 3 years. Written very much with Uhersky Brod in mind, as a lively, upbeat opener. Strange reference to Neil Young's rusting van from Cowgirl In The Sand.


Key: Dm (capo 5 Am shapes)

Recordings: Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod)

Dm		F	   Bb              G             Dm
I’ve just got no rapport wi  ma neighbours any more
Dm		F	   Bb              G             Dm
I think it bit the dust when the van began to rust
Dm		F	   Bb              G             Dm
Friendships stretch, buckle and they fall apart like iron files corrode
Dm		F	   Bb              G             Dm
My kitchen leaks and floods, my slovenliness shows

G		               F			            Am
And you’re telling me that it’s difficult to live here side by side
G		               F			            Am
You’re telling me we’re just human beings and it’s not really in our design 
G		               F			            Am
To come over and greet our brothers with unlimited false kindness
C			       Am	                  C		       Am
You saw it, you saw it, didn’t you? You didn’t get it at all
C			       Am	                  C		       Am
Oh You saw it, you saw it, didn’t you? You didn’t get it at all

How did it come to this when into this block I slid
I swear it was not me that upset your family
You’re beltin Slayer at unreasonable volumes for this town
In built-up areas, you gotta keep it down

And you’re telling me that it’s difficult to live here side by side
You’re telling me we’re just human beings and it’s not really in our design
To come over and greet our brothers with unlimited false kindness
You saw it, you saw it, didn’t you? You didn’t get it at all

D	   C	       Bb	       Am	
I suppose I’ll take it on the chin 
D	           C	 	Bb		         Am
I should’ve stood my ground  I shouldn’t let you win
D	           C		       Bb		               Am
But I can’t stand the pain of the constant petty things
D	       C	    Bb	          Am
So I suppose I’ll take it on the chin
Am		             G	         Bb	          	F
I’ve never been to Greece, I’ve never been to Leeds
Am		        G	   Bb		   F
Pull the trigger on terrible defeats
Am		    G	      Bb         		F
Why you got no face my terror is complete
D	    C	       Bb 	           Am
So I suppose I shoulda bombed your street

And it’s with no regrets I leave this shitty mess
You made it very clear that you possess your steer
One thing I’m saying as I’m leaving here to the one that fills my shoes
I only hope their life corresponds wi yours

And you’re telling me that it’s difficult to live here side by side
You’re telling me we’re just human beings and it’s not really in our design
To come over and greet our brothers with unlimited false kindness
You saw it, you saw it, didn’t you? You didn’t get it at all
