EUROPOP (STATE OF THE NATION)
=============================
Written autumn 2004, although sure I was still working at it a year later. Received its live debut in 2011. This used European nations as an analogy for a break-up, and was obviously prescient regarding (and well-used during) Brexit, which took any personal element right out of it!

Key: F#m (capo 2 Em/G shapes)

Unusual chords: Bm9 is fifth fret D and G strings, all else open; Dmaj7 C without the index finger; Em9 just a slide up two frets of the Dmaj7 (exact same move in COTIB and Discharge)

Intro: Bm9 Dmaj7 X3 Bm9 F#m

    F#m                        Dmaj7           
The wall crashed down into the West I ran
   F#m                      Dmaj7
Can't do U-Turns on the Autobahn
                 Em9                  F#m
You put so little in you get so much out
      Dmaj7    Em9            A
Is this what free trade's all about?

F#m                        Dmaj7
Buckfast, Mad Dog and a Nun that's Blue
F#m                                 Dmaj7
The tricoleur that guillotines what I did to you
     Dmaj7                 Em9                    F#m
They're storming the Bastille, and you're getting out
     Dmaj7            Em9             Bm9
Is this what Revolution is all about?

Bm9                     F#m
It's gonna take another day
Bm9                      F#m
Before it all gets washed away
 Dmaj7                        
And this long road away from annexation
 Dmaj7           Em9       Bm9
It's a stony, hazardous path.

Slaughtered toro and a carving knife
Not much rawer than an open life
The matador ain't got no time for doubt
Is this what independence is all about?

It's gonna take another day
Before it all gets washed away
And this long road away from
Annexation
It's a stony, hazardous path.

Instrumental: Bm9 Dmaj7 Bm9 F#m

The tundra winter of my discontent
Makes me wonder where the Gulags went
You put so little in you get so much out
Is this what dissolution is all about?
