CORONALAMENT
============
Written April 19 2020, in lockdown. Not being able to see each other, we set challenges across our various family sub-units, and I was tasked with Song Sunday. The kids and I had come up with a wee tune that we set everyone the task of writing lyrics to. The pathos of my mother's verses of not being able to see everyone is palpable (it may be tongue-in-cheek, but I don't think so). I soldered everything else together and got Elspeth to sing it. It's possible I may change some of the lines to make it less family-specific.

Key: C (5th fret G shapes)

C
I am feeling sad and blue 
F                G          C                
Because there's nothing else to do
C 
But stay at home and scrub and scrub
F          G          C
With no chance of a Sunday Club.

I miss you all but most the weans
The gossip and the carpet stains
I yearn so much to go and see
Exciting sights in Waverley.

F
I've got Covid 19 blues
[I'm sick of home, Bob called it true]
C
Newhaven Harbour's all good news
[The Revolution's not big news]
Am             F      C
I've thrown away my shoes 
Am              F           C
and I'll just sing the covid blues.

The blazing sun is beating down 
I'd love to see it outside town
But in the meantime thanks a lot 
For stimulating games from Scott. X

The same things happen every day, 
I cant think of any more new games to play.
Socially distanced, eating pies
And then my daily exercise

I've got Covid 19 blues
[I'm sick of home, Bob called it true]
Newhaven Harbour's all good news
[The Revolution's not big news]
I've thrown away my shoes 
and I'll just sing the covid blues.

I've thrown away my shoes 
and I'll just sing the covid blues.
