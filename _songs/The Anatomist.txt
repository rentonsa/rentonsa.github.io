THE ANATOMIST
=============
Written January 1995. This has had the longest life of any of the songs from teenage years, played as recently as 2012. This is because it showed a flicker of humour and 'meaty' subject matter (which there wasn't much of in the first 100 or so songs), so it ties in better with the more developed material. This was written in the Christmas holidays in first year at University and I think it was played live with Bullwinkle a week later. It was inspired by Jonathan Hagan's early exploits in his medical education, although I took things further than even he had experienced.

Key: F#m (capo 2, Em/G shapes)

Recordings: David Reilly (an early Bullwinkle acoustic recording exists, I think)

Intro
F#m	Dm	F#m
F#m	Dm	F#m
F#m	Dm	B

F#m		D		F#m
They made me watch you with an iron claw within
F#m		D		F#m
They made me touch you with a spoon under my chin
F#m		D		A
And do you think it's funny when you're watching from above
F#m		D		F#m
Do you think it's funny think I've suffered quite enough

They made me cut you d'you have to sign those forms to say
They could explore your body after your soul had flown away
And do you think it's funny while you're seeing my distress
Do you think it's funny now that you've gone to your rest

F#m		D		A
Oh I wish I could find another way
F#m		D		A
Oh I wish I could find another way
E		D
They don't understand they don't believe they don't think it's true
F#m		D		A
That while you were here on earth I was in love

Your head lies in a bucket in this cold and dreary place
They've got a hoover thing to suck out all the insides of your face
And do you think it's funny as you watch me shiver through all this
Do you think it's funny that somehow that face I still long to kiss

Oh I wish I could find another way
Oh I wish I could find another way
They don't understand they don't believe they don't think it's true
That while you were here on earth I was in love
