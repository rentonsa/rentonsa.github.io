UP N' COMING AREA
=================
Written March 2008- revisited Nov 2019. Wee selection of mainly true or slightly exaggerated occurrences or tales heard in the Drum Terrace flat. Leith is known for its gentrification- wasn't convinced it ever stretched to this street though!

In posh and central boroughs you can rent but canny buy
    G                                 Em
And if you take a mortgage that'll leave you high and dry
          G                          C
Until someone you trusted once says give my town a try
F        C          G
It's an up n'coming area

So you put your feet down in the shifting sands
Take the chance and board the bus for first time buyer land
Leave the blinkers long enough while your designs still grand
For an up n'coming area

(inst)

First your next door neighbour offers you a bath
Lets off bangers in the close- listen tae him laugh
Says he'll take you poaching if you stump up half
In an up n'coming reservoir

Tinny sounding telly, can't get channel five
Always at the mercy of carbon monoxide
Coded knocks on walls that remind ye you're alive
In this up n'coming area

Em            A
Oh what's that noise outside
Em                A
Armed response unit? Karaoke night?
Em                              A
Look out your window you'll see they've gentrified
C            Em
Everything but mine
C            Em    D
Everything but mine

You'll find you can condone the stoner's sorry plight
If you get Wish You Were Here fifteen times a night
Bingo callers vampires Reservoir Dogs lite
In an up n'coming area

You don't know your born if you think troubles that
Upstairs neighbours bathtub's dripping in yer flat
When you've got Keith Richards sleeping on yer mat
Or an up n'coming whoormaister

There's no polis oot the neet
Cos the young team control the beat
But there's new builds, pedestrianised streets
Everywhere but mine

So look at prospectus, check the stats o' crime
Check the local paper,  read between the lines
Potential fulfilment is gonna take some time
If it says up n'coming area
