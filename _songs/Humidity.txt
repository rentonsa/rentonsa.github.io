HUMIDITY
========
Written July 1994. A lot of barre chords in this song about asthma and teenage insecurity. As the opening number of Bullwinkle's first gig (though we were called Huddle or Domino at the time), this has the distinction of being the first of my songs to be played in front of people. This was flavour of the month about that time, but we actually dropped it quite quickly. With apologies to Rogers and Hammerstein.


Key: C#m

C#m                         G#m A
Another brown paper package
B
Tied up with string
C#m                         G#m A
More bad tidings it's an
B
Unchangeable rule
            E
What can it mean
       D
Time taking its toll
     Bb                    A
And a long hard look at itself
C#m                  B
Another brown paper package
A                 C#m
It's tied up with string

This humidity's making
My lungs contract
And reclusiveness to counter
Self-righteousness
Self-righteousness
Is it inherent
Is it borne of some bad crowd
Humidity it's making 
My lungs contract

D               C
And there's no general rule
                    G
Can't you see that for yourself
 D                C
And there's no general rule
                         A
Except the one that says we all must die

I'm just a lonely poor boy
Nowhere to go
And I can't afford to feel because
My reactions are slow
Claustrophobia
It's making me hurt
But what can I do
Humidity it's making
My lungs contract


Humidity's making my lungs contract
I've just got nowhere got nowhere to go
