THE ALMONDVALE FORAGING GROUND
==============================
Written July 2015. This is a song about Bruce's Alba Wines pursuits- he would leave work at lunchtime to go scavenging for cones to sell as Christmas decorations (Cones4U- I'd suggested the FirCone Warehouse), which led to berries to turn into wine. I took the analogy substantially further. It just about works.

Key: C

C                          Am
What are these seeds that grow on these trees
C                              G
And what are these things lyin' around
C                                                                                 A
I'll tell you 'bout [Desmond (his name's changed, you guessed it)] Brendan, name changed to protect him
         F           G        C
And the Almondvale Foraging Ground

[Starts as a skive because work's unalive]
Dreams of escaping because work's so frustrating
And the bosses are blithering drones
His doubts disappear when Christmas draws near
And he finds there's a market for cones

Em          D      Em                   A
Just need a sign, see what others don't see
Em           D     Em                    A
The investment's just time, raw materials free
[Down in a hole, potential tae climb
Is this now his role, or is he just biding his time]

What would be clever in West Lothian weather
Would be breaking the market right big
And the foraging ground will no let him down
You should see all the fruit on the twigs

Tayberry wine strawberry wine 
Elderflower bramble and gorse
[So much to gain that] To help with the strain he's bought a haywain
And an offlicence bottling horse

Pick up the glove, kill what others won't kill
The investment's just love, raw materials nil
[Down in a hole, just look at him climb
Is this now his role, or is he just biding his time]

You see where it's heading the west sided steading
Has MacIntosh trees for the larder
And the cider I'm guessing will become and obsession
And lead onto something much harder

I wish he'd said STOP US before he found the poppies
In this  big field in old Livingstan
Now he's dealing and taking awra smack that he's making
And we've lost him to junk- whit a man!!

Could go too far, roll where others won't roll
The investment's your heart, raw materials soul
[He's down in a hole, but he canny climb
Has he found his role, or is he just biding his time???]

But he's a good man, and he's gone to rehab
Happiness can still be found
"Cold turkey!", they said he's made herbal remed
