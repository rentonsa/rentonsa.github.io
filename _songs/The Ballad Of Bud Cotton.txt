THE BALLAD OF BUD COTTON
========================
Written in July 2004. Bruce thought we could write a song in the Waverley before OOTB, and perform it that very night. We did it, anyway. Not sure how successful it was, but we were right into puns at the time, and thought we could include one for each of the 18 holes in a round of golf, and then lots of golfers in the chorus.

Key: Dm (capo 5 Am shapes)

Recordings: David O'Hara


Dm		   Am	     Bb		       F		
Won the Swedish Open back when he was young
Dm		     Am	      Bb		   Dm	
Too much for his brain as he ascended rung by rung
Dm		      Am	       Bb		      F
Free to play the field now and didn't he by half
Dm		      Am	       Bb		      Dm
Foreplay not the answer he might just break his shaft

Fife-born golfing birdies harboured by his door
Sex came far too easy and he took more and more
Sinful days of itching made him start to fret
Ate his self-esteem and the bunkers he would hit/fairways heâ€™d not hit

Dm		
Torrents of love, torrents of love [Sam Torrance, Davis Love]
Am
Fall down on  his swing
Dm				Am
One pearl necklace too many else he could have been king [Kenny Perry, Jack Nicklaus, Ernie Els]
Dm
Torrents of love, torrents of love
Am
Guess he ain't gonna sing
Dm				Am
Wishing he'd just stayed a layman away from the ball steroids thing [Tom Lehman, Seve Ballesteros]

Nigh on nervous breakdown and struggling with the drink
Tender in the thyroid, and heid right doon the sink
A-Leaving in the morning, for the clinic's brood
Twelve o'clock decided clubs hung up for good

[solo]

Hurting, bored and idle, went looking for some work
For teen magazines he'd write, like a preacher in the kirk
Sifting through the letters, passing caution onto weans
Sextant, musket, trident, the Nelson of Blue Jeans

Sentimental thoughts went a-coursing through his mind
A tin soldier club pro, he couldny leave his kind
Nineteenth hole refreshments cluttered up the rough
Play off work the midgies, and clear the detritus

Torrents of love, torrents of love
Really would fck up his swing
One pearl necklace too many else he could have been king

Torrents of love, torrents of love
Guess he ain't gonna sing
Wishing he'd just stayed a layman away from the ball steroids thing

Ball steroids... that's viagra...
