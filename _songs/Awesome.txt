Awesome
=======
The tune was originally written in 1995 as 'Keep It In Mind', a Bullwinkle-era song that we didn't pursue; started trying to fit words to it when The Heartbreak Diet got going. I finally called it finished in July 2017. I feel a certain need to explain things in song I can't in conversation; in this case, the subject is my distaste for (the current usage of) a particular word, and I've been told it comes across as snobby, superior and pedantic. However, if it's not taken too seriously, it's one of my better attempts at humour in song. I do that "it's gonna rhyme with something dirty, I'll change it" trick which I used to do all the time in this one. Have probably offended a few people by chucking in a bit of Oh Lord My God When I In Awesome Wonder, but it "had to be done" (I'm sure He agrees it's a terrible misuse of his language).

A                           Bm
Language is a prize, it's fascinating
       D                  A
And it never stays the same
A                         Bm
Take a meaning, see it battered
         D                  A
And then accepted as a change

A              Bm                 E                   A
I've seen so much of this that I can't keep up- ooh yeah

A                       Bm
I've got one particular favourite
         D                 A
It describes things so immense
 A                               Bm
That they inspire jaw-dropping terror
        D              A
Beyond emotionally intense

A                          Bm                 E
It's the sort of word in a church you'd maybe hear
A                   Bm                  E
Bout saints and miracles, or a grand Damascene fear
G                                             E
Then the kids grabbed hold and something lesser brewed
G                                                 E
And now it means stuff that's maybe, well, quite good

A
It's awesome
E                   D
10% off a massage wi Groupon
A                                E             D
Awesome three score draws on my Littlewoods coupon
A                      E                      D
Awesome I think my granny's just put the soup on
A          Bm         E
... hit off a herbal high

If you're no more than eleven, 
Your transgression I shall waive
And I'll accept that you're just speaking
If you come from Adelaide

I don't mind (much) if your statements end with question marks not full stops

When you end sentences your voice gets a wee bit higher
You think that super is a valid qualifier
I'll absorb this, I'll take it on the chin
Cos there's only one word that's really for the win

It's awesome
I just walked a mile and got fitter
Awesome I just saw a January gritter
Awesome My dad's just vacated the shitter

... floored by a wrecking pillow

A                      D
Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
A                       D               E
Consider all the worlds thy hand has made
A                                 D
I say they're great, they're pretty bloody special
A                        D           E
Right on a par with that film about Bridesmaids 
OR  Right up there with your Wesley Snipes in Blade

I always swore that I would be down with the kids
Understand and get their culture, wishing my own parents did
But I'm just an old bastard, despite this childhood pact
Half the things weans do are grody to the max

Or awesome
Gin and tonic out of a can
Awesome went to Skye and came back with a tan
Awesome turns out Dame Edna’s really a man
Please talk right
