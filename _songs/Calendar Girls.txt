CALENDAR GIRLS
==============
Completed in June 2017, but it took a long time. This is quite sweet-sounding, and it's supposed to be optimistic (it's not too late, and we're enjoying ourselves), even though it's a lament regarding how old we're getting, and that it's probably too late to make it; hence the jealousy of the people with lots of pages left in their calendar of life... Do wish we'd started The Heartbreak Diet in the late 90s though.


Key: A


A                      D
Getting steamed up at tresses fair
F#m                            D
Each strand's an opportunity, to be, to dare
F#m                     
To make a mark on this world
              D          A
Because it’s gold not grey 

Her cards have not been stamped at the bygone border
So even at her dullest hatefullest they all adored her
While your calendar’s just wizened
The pages up and flown away

F#m          B
It's not a crisis
D                              A
It's just the fine mess that life is
F#M                  B
You gonna take this, Stanley?
D                      E
And whittle your life away (hey hey hey)
F#m            B
It could be amazing
D                                   A
Now's not the time for pastoral grazing
F#m               B
And though it's threadbare
D                       A
Maybe you could make it pay

You're picking off the scab, days are leaves off a tree
Like victims in your crosshair, you know those packs of Big D
And silence is the answer
When your popcorn's done

You're staring in the mirror at eroded cliffs
Encampment of past tents, army of what ifs
You envy all potential
And you're jealous of webs just spun

It's not a crisis
It's just the fine mess that life is
You gonna take this, Stanley?
And whittle your life away
You should be racing
Unlike the other animals grazing
And you can scrape through shopworn
Maybe you could seize the day

F#m   D    A  E
What follows? You've been feeling taunted since you saw the prize.
F#m  D  A  E
Tomorrow? You've been feeling haunted since you realised.

You’ve been feeling haunted since you smelt blood

It's not a crisis
It's just the fine mess that life is
You gonna take this, Stanley?
And whittle your life away
You should be racing
Unlike the other animals grazing
And you can scrape through sunbleached
Maybe just seize the day
Maybe just  make it pay
Or maybe you can... find your way

Discarded words:
[You should be racing
Unlike the other animals grazing
And you can scrape through threadbare]
