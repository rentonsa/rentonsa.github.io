MOSES
=====
Written while on strike, March 2018. Direct response to watching Threads and the whole idea of all the protections of society crumbling. Added a couple of verses during Coronavirus lockdown as it's the closest we've had to a nuclear winter in my lifetime. Rhymes see and sea- I think that's ok. I only realised afterwards that this was Paradise City, basically; if it ever gets played regularly, I'll throw those lines in.

Key: G

G                   
Magic box to tell the time
F
Paranoiac railway line
C
Let yer mints and caffeine take the strain

Meetings in disaster rooms
Hear the signals read the runes
Guttering to wash away the rain

[take me down to the paradise city
where the grass is black and no-one care's about being pretty]

Cooncils tae coordinate
Government tae keep us safe
Foreign and defence secs let us doon

Cause provocation, grandstand poses
Changing hinge on people's noses
Suddenly we're well past efternoon

                 Dm                      Am
You think you're Moses, think you're cradled
      C                           G
You've had rushes, so surely you could see
               Dm                       Am      
That wi one wee call to the wrong almighty
      C                            G
Chucked out and yer washed away to sea

Getting down tae blanken pages
Knock ye back tae older ages
Devastating aftermath ensues

De ye save the man wi expertise
Or bring in help fae overseas
The kind of mess ye'll no see on the news

You think you're Moses, think you're cradled
All this rushin' no-one wi eyes can see
That wi one wee call to the wrong almighty
Chucked out and yer washed away to sea

You think you're Moses, think you're cradled
All this rushin' no-one wi eyes can see
That wi one wee call to the wrong almighty
Chucked out and yer washed away to sea

Are we in a nuclear winter
Hard to get out once you're in there
Think you sowed it now it's time to reap

Asking you how strong your fear is
This is real though, this is serious
Close your drawbridge you've still got the keep

Here's yer permanent pollution
You'll have had yer evolution
Errs yer thoughts for when ye canny get to sleep
