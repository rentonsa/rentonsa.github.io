THIEVES
=======
Written August 2004. This really scrapes in, just because it feels quite complete and  David Reilly recorded a nice version when doing the OOTB Vol III session. What's it about? Plagiarism? 

Recordings: David Reilly

Key: Bm (capo 2, Am/B shapes)

Bm A
D                         Bm A
I sold a painting yesterday
D                          Bm A
Even though I knew it was shit
D                          Bm A
And he was nice enough to pay
D                                             Bm  A
I lied about the things that you could see in it

I didn't get where I'm not today
By ever playing by the rules
Which makes me vile enough to say
I attribute honesty to fools

E             D           F#m
And if that makes me a thief
E              D                F#m
Then you can throw your stone at me
E                 D                    F#m  
When you can tell me you're aglow with virtue
E  D F#m

There's a row of dirty cups
I've no intention of washing them
And one by one I'll use em up
It's only me who's drank from them (it's only me who's w****d in them)

And I guess it's really swell
There's nothing sicker than an infidel
And now I see I'm one as well
And you can damn me straight to hell

And if that makes me a thief
Then you can throw your stone at me
When you can tell me you've got goldstar virtue

And there's so much pressure on
To be original, inventive, creative, all the thinks that you expect to see
Don't even apply to this song
I stole the chords from Arthur Lee. See?
