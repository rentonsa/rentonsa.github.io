HENRY IX
========
Written late 2013, first song for a few years! Actually started out life as a daft song to baby son: "what'll we do Ronnie, what'll we do today?". Lyrics took a while to form, but ended up as a veiled comparison of David Cameron (in that he could be the Prime Minister to lose the Union) to Henry XIII and his reforms. Hence the verses' references to lost colonies of the British empire. Interesting that Cameron did achieve his notoriety, but not from the campaign in question at this time. The instrumental section was my favourite thing I wrote as a teenager, so shoehorned in as usual. Usually played with The Heartbreak Diet.

Key: A (generally play bass, but capo 2 G shapes otherwise)

Recordings: Gerry Callaghan

A  F#m

  A                   D                      F#m
I’ve got a burden of Tennessee bourbon And Meadowbank Chardonnay
          E                    F#m
It’s done time  In my high-tech mind
              A                         D                      F#m
She’s pretty certain That I’m facing curtains So I’m gonna stay away
            E                 F#m
What’s my line? Henry the ninth

E                                        F#m
I’m alone in Ajanta Caves watching people disappear
          D                                           E             
Where the paths to rights are clear, but the people disappear
E                                           F#m                          
I’m alone in a Jonestown grave watching people disappear
           D                                 A
With the ones that I held dear believing, blind

I’ve got a quota of Nicholas Serota and I’m gonna make it pay
I’ve got time to change their minds
She’s pretty certain That I’m facing curtains So I’m gonna stay away
What’s my line? Henry the ninth

Instrumental: D   A   F#m (x3) D  C?

I’m alone in a Kano nave watching people disappear
Christ, I should have changed career- still the people disappear                  
I’m alone in a Durban wave watching people disappear
With the Boers no longer here, the chat's just fine

I’ve got a version of needless coercion and  I’m gonna start today
What’s my line Henry the ninth
What’s my line Henry the ninth    
What’s my line
