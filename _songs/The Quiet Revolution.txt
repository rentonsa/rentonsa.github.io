THE QUIET REVOLUTION
====================
Written late 2015. A Heartbreak Diet jam went very well with a chord progression David came up with. In a contrast to the old style, I put these words to it, around the fact that the Scotland nearly won independence, highly unusually, without any violence.

Another night
E                               D
Owls and crows never give up a quarter
E                                   D
Mastiff hounds seen them fight to the death
E                                    D
And equal forces clash in massive reaction
E                                 D
Locomotive share a line with express
F#m                              D
See that cloud it's got a silver lining lining
F#m                              B
See that glass it's not yet drained
E                               D
See the despot gladly murder his rivals
E                               D
Fallout too from those whose colours don't run
E                               D
And revolution always numbers its victims
E                               D
With other men who don't brandish sword pick or gun
F#m                              D
See that cloud it's got a silver lining lining
F#m                              D
See that glass could yet be filled
F#m                              D
And I know that we are divided divided
F#m                              B
But not one drop of blood's been spilled
