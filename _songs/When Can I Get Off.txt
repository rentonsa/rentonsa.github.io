WHEN CAN I GET OFF
==================
Written at the end of 2003, the baby brother of Arnold Spark and Costa Rica in the triplet of songs that got me back into doing music. It's just about the daily grind (possibly subconsciously influenced by Joe Hartney, whose song One Day Like Another was big with me at the time): when are we allowed to get off the hamster wheel of not just work, but the routines that make up life. The vignettes mentioned don't back this up very well, they're effectively stream of consciousness, but it all ties in. I can't begin to remember how to play the optional intro verses; I think it's possible they've never been aired to the masses.

Key: F (capo 5 C shapes)

Recordings: David O'Hara, David Reilly

[Optional intro]:

Saddle up the moneybags
And throw away your tattered rags
Cos when you've sipped and supped 
You've got no way back

Life has never been so good
You're hanging out with Ronnie Wood
And the easiest lay on the White House lawn
Well that was Barbara Bush

You've become really deaf
To UNESCO and UNICEF
And the people that you thought you had so much
In common with

Sitting in your open plan
Practically bite off the hand
That feeds you with all of your
Leeway demands

C	Dm		Bb	C
I don't think that I want to be here today
C	Dm		Bb	C
The harder they work, the less they will pay
C	Dm		Bb	C
You gotta sit back and go with the sway
C	Dm		Bb	Am
Oh, when can I get off?

They asked me to help with the beavers and cubs
Just can't seem to function outside of the pub
Get a kebab, and stick on some dub
And we'll sing 'When Can I Get Off?'

I don't mind a time when I felt so alive
It's nearly ten years since I learnt to drive
And I still couldn't handle a Sinclair C5
Oh, when can I get off?

F	Bb	C
Roll out of bed once again
F	Bb	C
Hoping they'll blow up your train
G	Am	F	C
Oh they'll take out your soul and stick it in a jar
G	Am	F	C
Mix it up with your dignity, name, spirit and heart.

The polis is chasing a tiny wee guy 
For sticking his hand in the transit forbye
He's helping himself tae a Fray Bentos pie
Oh, when can I get off?

But there are some things that I still like to see
Like the migrating geese in the shape of a V
And when the afternoon sunset smirks through a tree
We'll sing 'When Can I Get Off?'

Roll out of bed once again
Hoping they'll blow up your train
Oh they'll take out your soul and stick it in a jar
Mix it up with your dignity, name, spirit and heart.

So I don't think that I want to be here today
The harder they work, the less they will pay
You gotta sit back and go with the sway
Oh, when can I get off?
Oh, when can I get off?
Oh, when can I get off?
