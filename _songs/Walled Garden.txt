WALLED GARDEN
=============
Written March 2020. Tune kicking about since 2006ish, possibly earlier, in the guise of 'Bothy Ballad' (I had a go at this, which didn't really work- I remember Dylan Matthews doing much better on it). It's supposed to be an allegory for populism, and the fact that progress shouldn't be assumed; just because America got Barack Obama in and looked really progressive, it doesn't follow, as we all know, that that naturally continues without a lot of work. Again, used an old tune for the bridge- a wee thing called 'Back In The Game' from 2008.

Key: C

Unusual chords: Fs played as a C shape 5 frets up. So not an F at all- a G9sus2.

F       
I work in this garden
                         C
And it could go National Trust
F  
Takes a power of grafting
                           C
Just to keep thing standing up
F
When they let us in here
                     C
The balance wasny right
F
But we got flax and dahlias 
                     C
To flourish side by side

Am
Maintain maintain maintain
       F          C
Protect protect protect
Am
But what I'm seeing's so much
   F              C
Sharper than neglect
Am
It seems like sabotage 
       F            C
Destroying my projects
      F                C
Wanting rain, getting poison

These freedom proclamations
Contaminated stream
I sprayed and sprayed the nuisance
But they've returned to the scheme
I had this sagacious master
Came in from out the box
Couped by a sickle razer
Who just let in the fox

Am
Maintain maintain maintain
       F          C
Protect protect protect
Am
But what I'm seeing's so much
   F              C
Sharper than neglect
Am
It seems like sabotage 
       F            C
Destroying my projects
      F                C
Wanting rain, getting poison

F  C X 3 Am C Am C F C

How much say do I get here
Really none at all
Nothing to do with progress
But taking back control
But you know they'll miss it
See what they have done
When all the natural beauty's
Been broiled by too much sun

Am
Maintain maintain maintain
       F          C
Protect protect protect
Am
But what I'm seeing's so much
   F              C
Sharper than neglect
Am
It seems like sabotage 
       F            C
Destroying my projects
      F                C
Wanting rain, getting poison
