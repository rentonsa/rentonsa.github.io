MINOR CRUELTIES
===============
Written late 2016. Chorus blatantly based on "take me down little Susie" line from Stones' Dead Flowers, but other than that, fairly workmanlike performance about a relationship that fails to thrive on the oft-beneficial friction.

Key: Em

Em                       D
When we got our act together
C               G
Elemental fury two
Em                          D
Fashioned from a bolt of lightning
C                        G
Plucked directly from the blue
Am                           C
Chance of such a steely couplin'
G                       D
Surely too intense to last
Am
We could see our future scampering into the past

Supposed to be each other's airports 
Final point we call home
Supposed to be each other's basecamps
Sheltered vale from which to roam
How did my tent get blown over 
Why did my bag not arrive
Storm that brought us just too violent to survive
           D                                    C                   G
But all the times when you said that you were coming and you didn't show
     D                              C                       G
Your absence was your present, your passage just a contraflow
          Em                                 D
There's a murmur underground that's soft and low
              D                 C                 G
If you don't plant on sunny ground what's gonna grow

Passing out your minor cruelties
Rationing the things I need
Givin' me crumbs of golden prospect
That never turn out to be seed
I knew that I was young and healthy
I knew that you were strong of will
Nothing but a bad trip slipping down your mixed up pill

Now I got my boat up lee side
Why you steer it to those rocks
Now I got my index peaking
Why you poisoning the stocks
Surely quicker ways to heaven
Than the paradise you promised me
I wouldn't say you're winning
But I think you might get free

But all the times when you said that you were coming and you didn't show
Your absence was your present, your passage just a contraflow
There's a murmur underground that's soft and low
If you don't plant on sunny ground nothing will grow
