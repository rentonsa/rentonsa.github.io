Peddler Of Trash
================
Originally, the tune was used for Never Again (words at bottom) (late 04); some of the ideas were
kept. New words were mainly written while travelling in 08-09. It's autobiographical, given the amount of time I 
spend on aimless, fruitless pursuits caught up in unimaginative 
technicalities and pedantries. In later years I've attributed it to my general loathing
of hipsters though.


Verse:
B
Probably trying to recover himself
Probably trying to discover his health
E                            B
Get tamed from his citizens' strains
B
Says he doesn't mind the long haul
Gets a chance to catch up on the Paul
E                                         B
Auster that's been idle on his shelf for a year

E                                F#
He's got a work ethic that's unrivalled
E                                F#
when it comes to travails self-defined
E                            F#
But I'd not describe it as vital
E
I think it's all in his mind

B                                E
Everybody's wildcat, everybody's prayer mat
B                           G#m
Everybody's hard-forgotten past
B               E
He's not bohemian
                       G#m    F#     E    B
He's one [stone cold] mighty fine peddler of trash

He'll establish his authority
when they burn down the libraries
Well schooled in the corduroy cool
[Replete with the full works of the beats]
And it's true, he's got total recall
ISBNs, editions, dates, all
The spiel, but I'm no sure he's getting the feel

[Think his thoughts were down by the river
Forensics say the gun's lost
Though they saw him careering towards it
Accruing no moss]

I think he crossed the roe with a zebra
With a secret so hard to keep
Begat from Dr Parnassus
And Dolly The Sheep

Everybody's wildcat, everybody's prayer mat
Everybody's hard-forgotten past
He's not bohemian
He's one [stone cold] mighty fine peddler of trash

[Understood by nobody else
Natural law unto himself
Well schooled in the corduroy cool
With the Stovies ate on his block
Doesnâ€™t smile much, and he doesn't much talk
Nae charm- but not doin any real harm]

And like a fugitive from a chainsaw
For whom success's smell is not sweet
They say he's most at home with the children
On Quantity Street

Everybody's wildcat, everybody's prayer mat
[Everybody's spare part, everybody's oxcart]
Everybody's turban, beads and sash
He's not Bohemian
He's one [stone cold] mighty fine peddler of trash
