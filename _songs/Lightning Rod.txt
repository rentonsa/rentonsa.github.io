LIGHTNING ROD
=============
Written May 2016 on piano. Very borderline inclusion- a wee conceit about a soldier not realising that he's been shot and is experiencing a continuation in his fight outside his body. First of many songs to feature that same lift at the start of the chorus.

Key: Am

G
Flick'rin' flames beneath me
Em
Mechanical reports
F                        Am
Illustrate heavy silence
G
I'm pretty sure I got him
Em
Ah seen the lightning rod 
F                         Am
And I was not born to lose


G
Demonstrably surrounded
Em
"Hello there", they entreat,
F                         Am
"Wanna see the new kingdom?"
G
I look for the next sucker
Em
But I cannot find my feet
F                         Am
"Just relax, sir, recline"

G
You could just let it go
F
See it's gone
Am
'Sall over


G
Charlie's lookin' different
Em
It's nape, more nape, and more 
F                         Am
And all my weapons are useless
G
I'm caught within a bubble 
Em
Sliding over gore
F
Though it's not blood in the holes


G
You could just let it go
F
See it's gone
Am
'Sall over
