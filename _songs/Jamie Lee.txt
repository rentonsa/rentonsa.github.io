JAMIE LEE
=========
Written initially in Feb 15, rewritten Malaysia 16. Daft wee fable with big question mark
as to the fate of the main character, but this was always a lot more about the tune rather
than the lyrics. Slightly inspired by a lamentable incident with David (Welsh) in Glasgow, May 14. David wrote the "Jamie Lee for you it's just another night bit". Another version - The Liberty Bell- was written as an alternative (as a rant about American imperialism etc)- lyrics to that at the bottom.


Key: D

F#m                    G   
She was a fluttering standard
            D
Through all my childhood games
F#m                           G
And though we got older her colours'
    D      
Vivid glow remained
F#m                              G
And when I took the role of the stitcher
   D         
Material as she
   F#m                       G
And oft on the hem of what's legal
    D
She didn't tangle me

     A                  Bm                
Jamie Lee I don't wanna see
         G                  D
Your long day's journey into night
         A                        Bm
I'm in a bind but I need peace of mind
        G                   D
Let me know that you're alright when I don't feel alright

I'm not placed to say when it happened
When the whisky slipped the cask
And somebody had to play Perry Mason
And of course I got the task
And when all of the options went wildgoose
Italicised and bold
They said that if I should ever get closure
I won't like what I'm told

Jamie Lee I don't wanna see
Your long day's journey into night
I'm in a bind but I need peace of mind
Let me know that you're alright

Jamie Lee I don't wanna see
Your long day's journey into night
I'm in a bind but I need peace of mind
Let me know that you're alright

    A                              
I know that you’ve found you a bigger room
        Bm                           
Like the man of means, no more the broom
      A                              
You worked out the system you made it pay
           G         A
Now it’s 21 each time

      A          Bm         G          D
Jamie Lee for you it's just another night
        A          Bm         G          D
Jamie Lee I only hope that you're alright
Jamie Lee for you it's just another night
Jamie Lee I only hope that you're alright
