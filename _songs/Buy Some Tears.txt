BUY SOME TEARS
==============
The only song (so far) in this list that I can claim almost no lyrical contribution. This was part of a two-song collaboration with Nyk Stoddart- these are his lyrics, written in response to the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. The tune has been around since 2004, originally as the very disjointed Omniresin (song about the EU referendum, 12 years before it happened), and other attempts at putting words to it have been unsuccessful. Nyk's version has a slightly different tune, which suits him better. To this end, I needed to add the second line of the chorus.


Key: D (capo 2 C shapes essentially)

Unusual chords: G add6 - D shape pushed along 5 with capo on 2nd fret

Gadd6                Bm7
I feel tense and empty
         G                              Bm7
The coughers roam the streets at night
Dmaj7                 Bm7
In their spangly disco shoes
                 Dmaj7     Bm7
They are quite an incredible sight


Stocks go up and down
Eyes with a medical frown
No one acts the clown anymore
We just move from town to town
wearing a sequined gown
With planets for our ears
With planets for our ears

(Dmaj7 pushed up 4 times)

Dmaj7             F#m           Bm7    
I might go to the shops this weekend and
     Dmaj7
I'll go buy some tears

And tussle with some cops- means to an end
I'll go buy some tears

I'm gonna buy some tears


The rain is gonna fall
Our leaders have dropped the ball
And the goalkeeper scores a goal
And we cheer from our sofas
Batting away the flies
While the watchers close their eyes
While the watchers close their eyes

We feel tense and empty
Like a pumpkin on halloween
Desolation row is deserted
And the stars leave the show
Live streamed from below
Hell isn't other people
It's just where we all go
