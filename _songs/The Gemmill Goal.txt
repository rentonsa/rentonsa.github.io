THE GEMMILL GOAL
================
Written late 2006, revisited 2020. Originally rewrote Suicidal Tendencies as we were playing at a birthday party for a Tartan Army zealot and I had realised that the words were no longer fit for purpose. Coming at it many years later, and determined to get the tune out there again, I used the image of the Gemmill goal as an illustration of Scottish ingenuity, talent and potential. With all that available we can emerge from the shadows of our better connected neighbour, but we need to show that we're world class more often than we do. 2006 words- inspired by sneaking into the Malvinas the previous year- at the bottom, but that didn't have the additional mad indy bibe.

Key: C?

Unusual chords: Em has the B and E strings of the third fretted- think it's just an Em7, A has the two fingers on B and E strings of the third fretted. I'm not sure what that becomes - I think A7sus4? Is that even a thing?

Em                      A                        
Ain't you lucky in your family ties
C                  Am           Em     A    Em  A
And everybody knows your big brother
Em                      A    
Ain't you lucky you've no feelings of doubt
C                  Am           Em     A    Em  A
And the weight of it don't make you suffer

                     G       Am   
See the wee man cut a swathe
   C
Past jansen Poortvliet and Krol
                        G     Am
Watch the wee man cut a swathe
            C
He's calmly planted the ball
                   G
Over Jonglbloed's sprawl
                 Am
It's a clarion call
                        Em    A
That says it's not too late

Ain't you lucky that you don't need to talk
When it comes to important decisions
Ain't you lucky that you don't get the knife
So you don't have to make the incision

See the wee man cut a swathe
Past jansen Poortvliet and Krol
Watch the wee man cut a swathe
He's calmly planted the ball
Over Jonglbloed's sprawl
It's a clarion call
That says it's not too late

F                                                Am         
You've too much talent to just be cowering in the wings
F                         C
As another show's been stole
F                        Am              E            
You an understudy, or could you do this every day?
G          Am     C
Assume a starring role
G         Am     C
Get out of your hole
G                          Am                    C
Just like Archie, just like Archie Gemmill's famous goal
             Em      A
It's not too late
            Em    A
It's not too late
           Em     A
It's not too late
             Em
It's not too late


2006 words

If you ever find yourself in Mendoza
There’s a stadium hidden with stealth
And if you make it over the barbed wire
You get it all to yourself

Archie Gemmill cut a swathe
Past Jansen, Poortvliet and Krol
Archie Gemmill cut a swathe
And calmly planted the ball
Over Jongbloed’s sprawl 
But even then we all
Knew it was too late

The moat is twelve feet deep
And presents a steep 
Obstacle to get to the field
If you went in no one would hear you scream
You’d die a martyr to the rampant shield

Archie Gemmill cut a swathe
Past Jansen, Poortvliet and Krol
Archie Gemmill cut a swathe
And calmly planted the ball
Over Jongbloed’s sprawl 
But even then we all
Knew it was too late

Like Gemmill’s goal, Malvinas is a remnant of grand construction ridden with flair
But like our hopes, though it’s not straightforward it’s fallen into disrepair
You'll be a shadow, you'll be a shadow of its former self
And it's too late
It's too late
It's too late
It'll be too late.
