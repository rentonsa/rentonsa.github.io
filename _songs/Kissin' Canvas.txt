KISSING CANVAS
==============
Written 2016. Pretty straightforward tune, but with a leaping move into the chorus that I've used about 4 times in the last 10 songs. It's about parenting, comparing the battles and need for resilience to boxing. Not amazingly perceptive, but quite pleasant. Instrumental break reuses the chord progression for the chorus of Dragonhide (1995), which was one of the last post-Bullwinkle things I did before running out of steam.

Key: G

Unusual chords: the Amaj7 is the C# power chord just played with the top finger removed

G                     Em
Sports car uncle drives by
        D                             C
Shiny objects, the kids just love him
G                                  Em
Thought by now he'd have given it a try
                    D                       C
But from where I'm standing, he's just settling in

And where does this leave you and I
I will never doubt it, we did the right thing
The book says gotta learn how to fight
And you'll be kissin' canvas all the way in way in

                   Em                C
It's a fright'nin roar, it's unrelenting
                G                   D
Cruise for the glider deal for the B-52
                     Em                   C
Then you can cool it down, sort of apprehend it
                G                         D
They caged the tiger, but we're getting oxygen through

Where's all the lights in this town
They on the outskirts, where the rent is cheap
Or have all the places shut down
Where they show their hands up and then get skin deep

Could you see more of ours
They're pretty crazy, they give us plenty
And the count seems to have jet fuel power
Still kissin' canvas, and we'll soon reach twenty

It's a fright'nin roar, it's unrelenting
Cruise for the glider deal for the B-52
Then you can cool it down, sort of apprehend it
They caged the tiger, but we're getting oxygen through

Instrumental:
C#5   Amaj7   E X 4

I wasn't borne, just tolerated
Warrior or Slider, Godfather straight or part two
And when it's all been done, and they're pretty sated
You're still beside her and she don't mind being with you
