CROSSING OFF TITLES IN BOOKS
============================
Written in the fairly productive summer of 2004. Another song about the automatic, robotic nature of what passes for my intellect: the snobbery of the namedrop, the all-consuming "that'll do" of e.g. watching your way through Halliwell's 4 star films (the guide is the book in question here), or reading a book by Noam Chomsky because that'll make you look intelligent, even if you don't take in a word of it. I can see this for what it is, but I continue to do it.


Key: B (G shapes capo on 4)

Unusual chords: G#m9- that's a slid up C chord two frets. It ceases to be an F# because of the unmuted open strings I suppose. Emaj7 just a C without index finger. Slide up two for what you'd think of as F#maj7, but open strings make it a  G#m9 (without index finger). The Em shape two fingers slid up one fret makes that a B13/G#, apparently. It really is a LOT easier than that makes it sound. 

Recordings: Dave Reilly, Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod)

G#m9						             Emaj7
How many times have you been to the pictures this winter?.
G#m9						             G#m
Sorry to ask, I don't wanna sound like a bore.
G#m9						     Emaj7
I used to go often, but now I just don't have the strength to
A		   C#m		                       Emaj7		A		    C#m		         Emaj7		
No matter even if Nyman had written the score; no matter how pretty the girl on the door.

Pack up your bags and we'll go on a journey to nowhere.
Bergen looks good, have you tried Bratislava or Prague?
Won't get off the ground, you know I just don't wanna go there
No matter how many stripes on the flag; no matter how many patches you'll sew on my bag.

F#7sus4				   Emaj7		         G#m 	                  B	
I'm sitting here, I'm inhaling the movies of Mallick, Kieszlowski, Fellini.
F#7sus4					   Emaj7		         G#m 	                  B	
Dropping their names, and crossing off titles in books.
F#7sus4					   Emaj7		         G#m 	                  B	
Don't get the pay-off, I worship false Gods, I'm a glazed spectator for hours
Emaj7               G#m9               G#m
I don't do anything, anything for the good sake
Emaj7               G#m9               			   B
I just do things in the hope they might make me look great.

When you read books do you count down the pages to finish?
Can you absorb or argue about what you've read?
Or is it about just being seen on the subway
Pulling out Kafka and Chomsky and Kundera's bed?
Did you get anything, anything of what they said?

I'm sitting here, I'm inhaling the movies of Wenders, and Clair, Bertolluci.
Dropping their names, and crossing off titles in books.
Don't get the pay-off, I worship false Gods, I'm a glazed spectator for hours
I don't do anything, anything for the good sake
I just do things in the hope they might help me save face.

I'm sitting here, I'm inhaling the movies of Godard, Forsyth, Kurosawa.
Dropping their names, and crossing off titles in books.
Don't get the pay-off, I worship false Gods, I'm a glazed spectator for hours
I don't do anything, anything for the good sake
I just do things in the hope they might keep me awake.
