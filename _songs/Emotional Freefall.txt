EMOTIONAL FREEFALL
==================
Written September 2001. This wasn't the first thing I'd written since I got back into writing songs (after five years of nothing), but it felt like it as I played it so much in the house. Histrionic (embarrassing, actually) post-breakup stuff; hadn't really discovered my voice at all at this point, but it had quite a good rhythm and interesting changes. Despite all, it's rarely been played in public but because I included it in the "Extreme of Consciousnees" gig, there's a good recording of it.

Em           F             C               Am
And so you've come around and wound it all up
Em           F             C               Am
And now you're ready to proclaim
Em           F             C               Am
And now you're free to make the beast with one back
Em                                  G
Oh don't you think you might have blown it all again

And at the time you couldn't feel worse
So how do you feel now
Because she's free to make the beast with three backs
Oh don't you think that's not so different anyhow

Bm                 D             A        E
I think you're falling into emotional freefall
Bm                 D             A        E
With every gate you pass through you get lower
Bm                 D             A        E
You're in the pit so deep you can't get out again
Cmaj7                  Am
Couldn't you just have loved her?

You gotta break an egg to make an omelette
And now you're standing there in broken bits of shell
You gotta tear it down to build it back up
And so you tore it down, now Billy Idol, Rebel Yell

I think you're falling into emotional freefall
With every gate you pass through you get lower
You're in the pit so deep you can't get out again
Couldn't you just have loved her?
