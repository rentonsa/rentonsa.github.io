HIDDEN FORCES
=============
Written in 2007. Tune had been awaiting words for a few months, and were squeezed out in time for the EFC Songwriting Competition, using the recent cohabitation move as subject matter- military imagery used for that... Songwriting competition came far too soon for it, it was a good few months before the song bedded in, as is usually the case.

Key: Dm (capo 5 Am / C shapes)

Recordings: Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod)

Dm	  		          Bb                          F                                         

C
Rest yer weary head on this soakin bed for the last time tomorrow we must go
Dm	  		          Bb                          F                                         C           F
They will make us leave like we’re guilty thieves for the darkness, the mud and bitter  snow
Dm	  		          Bb                          F                                         C
You will find it strained I’ll be often blamed you’ll call me all the names under the sun
Dm	  		          Bb                          F                                         C           F
But you need tae see over aw thae tree’s that our forest’s blossom has begun
C	                               Dm
I would never, I would never go
Dm	  		          Bb                          F                                         C
Wi defiant stance there we must advance at the danger that’s coming ower the wall
Dm	  		          Bb                          F                      C           F
Wi our freedom loosed and our freedom chained is our freedom relevant at all
C	                               Dm
I would never, I would never go
	          Bb                       F       Dm                  F                C               A
But when this world’s all hidden forces what matters now is where the arrows fall
Bb                              F                     C
Point to point the old Chinook is landing
Bb                              F                     Dm
Point to point our coats are on our backs
Bb                              F                     C                  Bb                      F                 A
Point to point the sound of our connection is roaring and howling down the track
Bb                              F                     C
Point to point they’re handing out instructions
Bb                              C                     Dm
Point to point they’re making up our packs
Bb                              F                     C                  Bb                      C                 A
Point to point the sound of our connection is roaring and howling down the track
Bb                      C                 F
Is roaring and howling down the track
