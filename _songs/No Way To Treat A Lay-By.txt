NO WAY TO TREAT A LAY-BY
========================
Written early 2004. Astonishingly bad pun, but worked at the time. About the famed Gillian Taylforth incident. Close brush with fame when a Channel 4 researcher got in touch. They were making a documentary about said occurrence. Once they heard it, their interest waned.

Recordings: David O'Hara, David Reilly

Key: Em

--Gather round boys, and I'll tell you a tale
--About a young man from Llanelli in Wales
Em                                Cmaj7
Gather round boys, I've decided to write
Em                                Cmaj7
A song about a man called Geoffrey Knights 
--should really be more suggestive, i.e. "about something that happens every night"
Em                                Cmaj7
In the Range Rover, took his baby to town
Em                                Cmaj7
And yeah he thought that there was noone around.
D Am Cmaj7


So they got in, yeah they got in the car
And the distance, well it wasn't too far
Headlights flashing, while they was splashing around
Wrong to think that there was noone around.

D             Am               Cmaj7 
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
D             Am               Cmaj7 
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
D             Am               Cmaj7 
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
D             Am               Cmaj7 
That ain't any way no way no way.

That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way no way no way.

Instrumental was D G using barres X3 descending Bm A C

Best of both worlds, getting motorway fun
And 200 grand from the soaraway Sun
Working with your feet two feet under a Beale
Don't you tell me that this doesn't appeal, but

That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way to treat a lay-by
That ain't any way no way no way.
