ARNOLD SPARK
============
In some ways, this song represented the return to doing music in late 2003, discovery of Out of the Bedroom etc. Sadly the title is yet another pun- everything was in those days- and the use of swearing is generally avoided these days. Still, it just about works as an image- I was still a bit rudderless at this point, and this is a reasonable bit of introspection into my fairly vegetative situation at the time and my keenness to shake it off.

D					A
Well I'm trading in my soul for a better model
D				A
I think I've just had this too long
		F#m
There's nothing wrong
		E
I just want the other one
	Bm			E
The one with wings, the one that fires the gun

D						A
Oh, I'll part-exchange my heart for one that's beating
D					A
And I'll probably get some cash for that
		F#m
But the battery's flat
			E
I can love as well as anyone
        Bm		D   Dm  A 
Maybe I just don't understand the VAT

D			E
She says, "Don't be so dramatic,
G		E
Don't be so fucking posh.
D		E
Aw's ye need's a service
G
New set of headlamps
E
And a damn good wash!"

Oh, I'll part-exchange my heart for one that's beating
I'm gonna do it, I've just not done it yet, 
'Cause I know I'll regret
Banging around in this old wreck
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it in the neck.

He says, "We don't still make the parts, no,
For your exhausted steering wheel,
But if you don't mind a cut-and-shut
I can do ye a right good deal".

Oh, I'll part-exchange my heart for one that's beating
I'm gonna do it, I've just not done it yet, 
'Cause I know I'll regret
Banging around in this old wreck
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it in the neck.

Well I'm trading in my wife for a supermodel
I think I've just had this too long
There's nothing wrong
I just want the other one
With no bingo wings, the one that swallows ...

Oh, I'll part-exchange my wife for one I can beat on
And I'll probably get some cash for that
But the battery's flat
I can love as well as anyone
Maybe I just don't understand her brat

She says, "Don't be so dramatic,
Don't be so fucking posh.
Aw's ye need's a service
New set of headlamps
And a damn good wash!"

Oh, I'll part-exchange my wife for one I can beat on
I'm gonna do it, I've just not done it yet, 
'Cause I know I'll regret
Banging around in this old wreck
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it in the neck.

He says, "We don't still make the parts, no,
For your exhausted blow up doll,
But if you don't mind a topless wank
I can do ye a soapy brawl".

Oh, I'll part-exchange my heart for one that's beating
I'm gonna do it, I've just not done it yet, 
'Cause I know I'll regret
Banging around in this old wreck
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it in the neck.
