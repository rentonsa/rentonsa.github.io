The Don Cunninghame Graham
==========================
Originally written early 2008 as Kael Thomson Mombelli for Bruce's first son's naming ceremony. Tune had been kicking about for a year by then. I wanted to be able to perform the melody in public, as I felt it was quite rousing, so rejuvenated it as a paean to Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham on the suggestion of my father.

Key: G here (although occasionally raise/lower)


G                         F                                G
I don’t know if you know bout the man that they cry Don Roberto
G                                  F                    G
I don’t know if you know bout the prodigal gaucho back home
G                        F                       G
So I’ll tell ye of how he stood up for the unrepresented
G                                 F                  G
After learning his trade in the pampas and Aztecan zones
F    G

His adventurous youth saw him ranching and fencing and fighting
Disguising himself and befriending Buffalo Bill
He returned to cry home role and back up the poor and the needy
Took a beating at one Bloody Sunday as proof of his will

Em 
The Don Cunninghame Graham
 C                         G
He’ll never withdraw in the sun
Em 
The Don Cunninghame Graham
          C                G
His work here has hardly begun

His first role in parliament saw him right wrongs wi the Lib’rals
And then with Keir Hardie embarked on a Labour of love
Not finished with that, he helped make the Nationalists viable
I just hope that he’s not perched upon a blue cloud up above

The Don Cunninghame Graham
He’ll never withdraw in the sun
The Don Cunninghame Graham
His work here has hardly begun

Fiddle

So get thee to Gartmore and learn of this modern day Robin Hood
It’s by Aberfoyle and you’ll have ye a nice day I’m told
It’s a sprawling estate and it’s proof if you ever should need it
Though the spoon may be silver, the heart can still be solid gold
