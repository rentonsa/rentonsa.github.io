FAMOUS AFTER I'M GONE
=====================
Completed October 2018, but largely written while on a roll of activity in summer '17. Straightforward tongue in cheek conceit: the idea of posthumous fame and that the world just hasn't caught up with me yet (in reality I probably got here too late- I'm hardly innovating!). 

Key: Bm (capo 2- Am or C shapes)

Recording: Adam Naylor

Bm             A      D
Hats off to wee Nicky Drake
G               D                  A
Elfin, withdrawn but ingenious purveyor of
Bm            A     D
Music with zero uptake
G                       D
Until he'd departed this world

Hats off to big Johann Bach
Hauns like a centipede- ask his congregation
But his own songs just made people laugh
Until he'd departed this world

F#m                G         D
Could it be thus for yours truly
G                                A
Whose music is tired and lyrics just woolly
F#m                G         D
Maybe you'll let on you knew me
G                           A
After the culture approves me

Bm              A         D
I'll be famous after I'm gone
G                           	     A
My world isny ready for the things that I've done
Bm                A         D
And maybe to our future's sons
            G             A
I'll be posthumously essential
               Bm   A   D
And famous after I've gone

Hats off to Vincent Van Go
Those folk that say "data" call Van Gogh Van Go
But his sales were still awfully slow
Until he'd departed this world

Could it be thus for yours truly
Them at the Art School they laughed long and fully
But up in the attic, all stoorie
Is a goldmine of badly daubed jewellery

I'll be famous after I'm gone
My world isny ready for all that I've done
And maybe to our future's sons
I'll be posthumously essential
And famous after I've gone

William Kemmler was no fashionable
Till, granted, he battered his wife with an axe
Electric chair's skeleton flash
Which made him depart from this world

Could it be similar for this guy
Be famous for nothing but the way that I died
Like the first to be jigsawed or drowned in tie dye
I'd still make more headlines than had I survived

I'll be famous after I'm gone
My world isny ready for all that I've done
And maybe to our future's sons
I'll be posthumously essential
And famous after I've gone

Mull over this if you can
If they ever find the right Lockerbie man
To charge him they won't get a chance
Because he's departed this world

#There are some right horrible people around
#Who while they're alive don't get found out
#They're thought of as saints or at worst harmless clowns
#Until they depart from this world

And while I have never done anything grim
It all might point to my being guilty as sin
Christ they'll dig up my grave and burn my coffin
And I won't get a chance to refute all the spin

Och, forget all of this and remember
That when your life hits its December
And finally return to sender
The people that count aren't Academy members

And I only hope after I've gone
That I've laid a foundation for daughter and son
To say "your dad was alright", or "your grandad's light shone
I'm glad that you got to meet him."
Thatâ€™s all the fame you need be seeking
After you've gone
