Flying Tonight
==============
Completed July 2017. Extremely sentimental by my standards- written for my mother and wife regarding the sacrifices they've made for their children, and how I would like to make it up to them. Various ideas- harmonica over the guitar riff in the intro, could put flute/fiddle into interlude.

Key E (capo 2 G shapes)

E                     A          E
Circuit’s short, all heat and no light
E                     B         E
So you and me, we’re flying tonight
E                 A      E
Sticking down onto this kite
E                       B          E
I’ll wrap it round you perfectly tight

C#m          A                   E
Dust off your shoulder, it’s time someone showed ya
C#m          A                   E
All the places that we never went
C#m          A                   E
Do one last solder, we’re revving the motor
C#m          A                   E
It’s a levy, and I must see it spent


C#m             E
Banking to the north
C#m             E  
Tapering west
A      F#m       E
I know when I'm blessed

Disconnect the red telephone
We’ll get some blood out of this stone
Just rewards for saintly deeds done
Which manifest in seeing them grown

Your Summerisle, your Atlantis, this binding contract says
We'll see places uncharted as yet
Don't need assistance, and no heed for distance
It's impending and the terms have been set

Banking to the north
Tapering west
I know when I'm blessed

Break
Bm-D-A-Gx3

It's taken me so long to realise
That if somebody passes advice
The lesson taught, oh it may not suffice
But it's currency, and you call the price

Though we're not newborn, so often the view's drawn
When it's staring right into your face
With the next blue dawn there's another few gone
And chances aren't given to waste

Banking to the north
Tapering west
I know when I'm blessed
