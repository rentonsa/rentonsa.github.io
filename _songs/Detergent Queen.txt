DETERGENT QUEEN
===============
The earliest song that's in any way survived into adulthood. Written late 1993, words by David Welsh, which were quite rich. I think he'd envisaged a country song, but I just took them and rewrote a slightly more stark, vocabulary-light number called One Last Time. Rehearsed with Bullwinkle but never performed. Heartbreak Diet may do it for others' pleasure. The actual identity of The Detergent Queen is vehemently denied.

Key: C

Em          F     Am           F
Many years ago I'd dream about you
Em         F          Am             F
But even then you'd never ever look my way
Am                  F        Am             F
You never liked the ones with dirt on their nails
Am                         F              C
You only liked the ones who washed it all away

At that time I really thought I had a problem
Now I know the problem was you
It ain't from where you come it's where you're at
It's all I've got and it'll have to do

G                F               E
Lord I have lost my Detergent Queen
F                               C
She'll only like you if you're clean
G              F                         E
My soapy perfumed scent don't know where she went
F                             C
Perhaps she's found her Mister Sheen

I feel withdrawn I can't sleep at night I'm  under pressure
I've come undone I've lost the place I know forever
I'll be upset I'll never get her
Now I've seen her leave with him not me

I want your help I need someone to stop me falling
I need your help to stop me falling
To stop me becoming a stone that's rolling
Into the void they call a broken heart

Lord I have lost my Detergent Queen
She'll only like you if you're clean
My soapy perfumed scent don't know where she went
Perhaps she's found her Mister Sheen

Many years ago I'd dream about you
But even then you'd never ever look my way
You never liked the ones with dirt on their nails
You only liked the ones who washed it all away

She said to me "show me something that'll make me consider it"
I said to her "I'll love you always you can depend on it"
Then she noticed that I wasn't immaculate
I'd made such a mistake

Lord I have lost my Detergent Queen
She'll only like you if you're clean
My soapy perfumed scent don't know where she went
Perhaps she's found her Mister Sheen

Lord I have lost ah-oh-ah my Detergent Queen
She'll only like you if you're clean I said if you're clean now
My soapy perfumed scent don't know where she went
Perhaps she's found her Mister Sheen
