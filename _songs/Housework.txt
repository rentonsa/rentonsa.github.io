HOUSEWORK
=========
Written December 05. Written for And Me Wi A Bad Leg Tae. SBL and NDHAD have been played countless times, while this quiet, reflective number (with an appalling pun on Proddy Gal)
has never interfered with the public's ears. Doing this has meant I've worked out how to play it again, 15 years later. Still not sure about that F#.....

Recordings: Jim Sutherland

Key :D (capo 7 G shapes)
Unsual chords: keeping pinky on third string E for C shape (Cmaj7 + that), G shape, Em shape

A         G         D  Bm
See this effin' wallpaper
       D           Bm
It's peeling at the rim
           A         G         D  Bm
And the cat's been throwing up a lot
      D               Bm
It needs at least a trim
           A         G         D  Bm
And you you lazy waste o' space
          D                 Bm
Wid ye please get aff yer arse
           A         G         D  Bm
Ye tak the mick ootae aweeyus
     D                Bm      D
And ye break yer mither's heart

Ungrateful disny cover it
All that she's done for you
She's got a bad leg too, ye know
Yet decomposing's aw ye do
If ye were like yer brother, ach
We'd like ye so much more
For one thing he's responsible
But the main thing is he's awa

F#m                        G
That's right, he'll be returning
        Em                      F#
So leave your judgement, dinny row
F#m                        G
Prodigal? Son, check your bible,
         Em                      F#
It's not about who he's seeing now 

For God's sake, all we want is for
This house to be a home
Be nice to be Palladium
Not papershop and comb
So take this bloody hoover please
Don't do the job by half
And I promise ye ye'll get yer share
When we kill the fatted calf
