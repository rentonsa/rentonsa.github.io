LEFT AT REGENT
==============
Written September 03. This was written at a prolific time but lacked inspiration. I had a Ryan Adamsy thing in my mind for it. The idea was that I couldn't turn left if coming along Princes St because I'd locked Leith out as an option due to... decisions! Keeping it in just because it was the first song I'd played at Out of the Bedroom, and therefore, the first song I'd ever played on my own in public.


Key: C

Intro: C F G F x 2
F  
And your New York City skyline
          C
Ain't no Africa to me
     F                        C
Your apples we kept 'em by the sink
         F 
And your black and white fresh photos 
        C
That I guess I'll never see
    F                       C
Don't leave me any time to think.

You say it with your silence
You say it with your frown
Say it with your never being around
And I say it with my nightmares
And I say it in my dreams
And I say it 'cause I'm living underground.

Am             F           G          C
You've got the whole world in your hands
Am        F      G       C
And I can't even stay awake
Am           F                G       C
You've got the whole world in your hands
  Am          F           G     C 
And I've got nothing left to take.

C F G F x 2

I miss the burdens you used to lay on me
I miss your cold and thankless kiss
I miss the fighting, I miss the tears
But most of all, I miss the things I've missed.

You've got the whole world in your hands
And I can't even stay awake
You've got the whole world in your hands
And I've got nothing left to take.
