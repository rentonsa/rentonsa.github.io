TIRED OF LIFE
=============
Written July 2017. An attempt to write a bluesy thing around a riff, with a rather daft message about excess. Keeping it in because it's notably different to everything else in here. Can't sing it with a Scottish accent. Very open to a lyrical rewrite.

Key: E (but no Bs in it?)

E   
There's a guy I know and I know him well
              D                 A
Who'd rather rest in peace or rot in hell
         E
Than be tired of life

And he knows heâ€™s good and he knows he's bad
Gives instruction to the stable hands
Who are tired of life

He's ditched the rules, disdained the laws
Money under floorboards, guns in drawers
Not tired of life

And he don't do tax or licence fees
Advisers on Barbados, debtors on their knees
And tired of life

        G                            D
Life's pretty short, and we're not all caught
      A
In the same pool
                            E
Is that a different point of view?
            G                    D
You got your own rules don't suffer fools
         A
It's a big city... and when a man tires of London
      E                        D    A    E
He tires of life

"You gotta break the law, come on, why not?
I know folks and ways so you won't get caught"
I'm not tired of life

"And you've got the right to defend your zone
Shoot any fool intruder breaks into your home
You tired of life?"

"Vice is good. Freedom same.
I can put it all on expenses claims
Not tired of life"

"To put it all in summary
I can wrap my Buick round the nearest tree
I'm not tired of life"

Life's pretty short, and we're not all caught
In the same pool
Is that a different point of view?
You got your own rules don't suffer fools
It's a big city... and when a man tires of London
He tires of life

I saw a priest asked is this true
Are these all the things I'm supposed to do, not to be
Tired of life

And he just replied "I've no time to deal"
I got things to do and this is just making me feel
Tired of life

So I faked my finances, got some info, bribed the cops
Shot some robbers, drugged some dancers I was definitely not
Tired of life

And I guessed something awful had become of me
So I wrapped my Maserati round the nearest tree
