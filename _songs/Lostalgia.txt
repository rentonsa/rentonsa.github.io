LOSTALGIA
=========
Written March 2020. For want of anything better to write about on holiday in Tighnabruich, I embarked on an unabashed trip down memory lane. I am obsessively nostalgic, so when I revisited this a few months later it just rolled out. Nobody outside of my own family would get all the references. Not very happy with the James/Derek line. The tune dates back to 07, and ultimately became Miserabilia, a song which could have been interesting, but I just couldn't find convincing examples.

Key: B (G shapes on 4)

C#                    G#m
Rusting white datsun bluebird
C#                              G#m
Nae seatbelts anywhere still felt really safe
C#                    G#m
Drumoyne Sundays wi the grand-folks
C#                    G#m
Singalong with Bing, Bullseye, Cavalcade
C#                    G#m
Lot of time altar serving
C#                    G#m
See at Christenings, the money that you made
Emaj7       F#     G#m   C#
Beezer Topper Whizzer Chips
Emaj7      F#             Ebm                  B
Alpine Van Salt n Shake and the chimps from PG Tips

B        Emaj7  G#m        
It feels like yesterday
B             Emaj7     G#m                F#
My long term memory's a curse won't go away
B            Emaj7         G#m 
Both sighted wrinkled and grey
Emaj7       F#            G#m   C#
And though I feel I'm on level ground
Emaj7      F#             Ebm             B
From where I stand it's such a long way down

Want to mention strike cola 
Because they'd not bar the Irn Bru till adulthood
Knowing every word the charts had to offer
Which meant we felt the likes of Billy Ocean were quite good
Now You See It, Take The High Road
Ach STV was something you just understood
Spectrum 48K Input Magazine
Match Day Chequered Flag Horace Goes Skeen
 
It feels like yesterday
My long term memory's a curse won't go away
Both sighted wrinkled and grey
And though I feel I'm on level ground
From where I stand it's such a long way down

No just the Old Firm Competing
And four or five teams showing on the Euro stage
Nascent politic leaning
Owed a huge amount to Spitting Image
And so we knew we'd take no Tories
Although at that time, well, they'd triple locked the cage
Sally James and Bo Derek
Glens Hutchisons Robertsons Stepek
     
It feels like yesterday
My long term memory's a curse won't go away
Both sighted wrinkled and grey
And though I feel I'm on level ground
From where I stand it's such a long way down
