YOU AIN'T GETTING NOWHERE
=========================
Written in response to the Daily Record's Vow, which was a defining point of the 2014 referendum, and the clearest sign yet that the establishment simply wouldn't let Scotland go. You'd do well getting that out of the lyrics. Obviously a nod to Dylan/The Byrds in the title. This did comprise a tune that Elspeth came up with (at under 5!) and a daft Gospelly thing I'd had in the locker for years (see The Almighty Fall). While knitting them together has been the way we've done it with The Heartbreak Diet, I've never been happy with the soldering job, so I wrote a more congruous chorus in 2018, and wrote new words to the other bit to try to get two living organisms out of killing one.

Key: Dm (capo 5, Am / C shapes)

  Dm                    Am
When you wake up far too often
  F              C
With your bullets drawn
                    Dm
Your stomach just torn
                      Am
With your bullets drawn
               F
You must be alone

There's no rival like the woman
To your brittle soul
When she made you a promise
To your brittle soul
Let's you think you've won

           F         C       F
She drew me in and I followed
                    C             F
She drew me in the bit got swallowed
                 C          Dm
She drew me in the vow was spoken
          F          C        F
She drew me in completely broken

So she said, "you ain't getting nowhere.
Another promised land?!"
Where the grass was just greener.
Another promised land:
Not having that.

So it seemed- the cow delivered
Just offensive charm
It didn't mean nothing
Just offensive charm
She'd not follow through

She drew me in and I followed
She drew me in the bit got swallowed
She drew me in the vow was spoken
She drew me in completely broken

        F         C    F
Oh Lord she drew me in
        F         C    F
Oh Lord she drew me in
                   C          Dm
She drew me in the vow was spoken
         F           C           Dm
She drew me in completely broken
         F            C          F
She drew me in now I'm full awoken

[A capella]
           F         C       F
She drew me in and I followed
                    C             F
She drew me in the bit got swallowed
                 C          Dm
She drew me in the vow was spoken
          F          C        F
She drew me in completely broken

  Dm                    Am
When you wake up far too often
  F              C
With your bullets drawn
                    Dm
Your stomach just torn
                      Am
With your bullets drawn
               F
You must be alone

There's no rival like the woman
To your brittle soul
When she made you a promise
To your brittle soul
Let's you think you've won

      Bb                       F
And when at last the haze got raised up
      C              Dm
Well I saw- she drew me in
          B                     F
The bit got swallowed, and yeah I followed
    C               Dm
How can I walk again 

So she said, "you ain't getting nowhere.
Another promised land?!"
Where the grass was just greener.
Another promised land:
Not having that.

So it seemed- the cow delivered
Just offensive charm
It didn't mean nothing
Just offensive charm
She'd not follow through

And when at last the haze got raised up
Well I saw- she drew me in
The bit got swallowed, and I just followed
How can I walk again
