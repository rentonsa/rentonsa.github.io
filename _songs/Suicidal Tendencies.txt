SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
===================
Written June 1994, when I could knock a song out in 20 minutes. Obviously the lyrics are full of unnecessary histrionics, based on nothing I could relate to, but that wasn't really the point. The tune is more interesting than anything I could come up with these days, if slightly influenced in the chorus by The Band's Stage Fright (I was watching The Last Waltz a lot at the time). I've included it here as one of four Bullwinkle songs, but probably my favourite of them; it survived into 'adulthood' for a year or so, and has been rewritten as The Gemmill Goal so the tune can live on.

Key: C?

Unusual chords: Em has the B and E strings of the third fretted- think it's just an Em7, A has the two fingers on B and E strings of the third fretted. I'm not sure what that becomes - I think A7sus4? Is that even a thing?

Em                      A                        C     Am    Em     A    Em  A
Amanda was sixteen and innocent but Bob wanted to be her master
Em                      A                             C    Am                Em  A   Em  A
She was walking away she was moving away from him cos he wanted to push it faster
                      G       Am   C
And now she's saying "Wait!" as he's running to the shore
                       G           Am       C
Oh she's saying "Wait! You've threatened these things before-
                    G                       A         
Come away from the edge, come away from the ledge, we'll try again!"

So she got him back and it soon became clear thirty year old guys are stronger than girls of sixteen
Shameful discourse, he felt such remorse, that he exemplified his central theme.
And now she's saying "Wait!" as the knife's coming under his coat
Oh she's saying "Wait!", but her cry is so remote
It's in his heart, but it's in his heart, and it's too late.

F                       Am              F                      C
And if you've got suicidal tendencies, keep them from those you love
F                        Am              E            G                Am     C
And if you've got a will to be somewhere else, you'd better keep it to yourself
G       Am        C
Oh keep it to yourself
           G                      Am                  C
You'll be a shadow, you'll be a shadow of your former self
             Em      A
And it's too late
            Em    A
It's too late
           Em     A
It's too late
             Em
It'll be too late.
