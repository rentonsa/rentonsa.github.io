HARRY POTTER
============
Written July 2017. This absolutely fell out in a couple of hours (by my adult standards that's fast), mainly because it's pure vitriol. I can't put my finger on why I despise HP so much, so I just went for it. Almost never played live because it so offends people (who absolutely ADORE Potter- about 80% of the population as far as I can see). I even broke my swearing embargo on this one, although it sounds awffy half-hearted these days. Almost no perceptible tune whatsoever.

Key: G

            G                           Em
There are things I can't abide: teenage Tories, peanut butter
                       D                            C
But right up there with Will.I.Am, it's Harry F8cking Potter

Some wizards are alright if you like software installers
You can see my baby jive, unless you're Harry Potter.

I can't get past the name: I'd be alright with Trotter
Cotter Soutar Slaughter- cause they're not as mild as Potter

And Harold's solid Saxon stock, but Windsor when it's shorter
Barry, Larry, Garry- they’d all suit much on ya

         C                            G
It's as bourgeoisly positioned as a Con-Lib coalition
        Em                         D
Makes benign school gaters cream themselves
         C                                   G
I'm told that the "Death Eaters" suck the lives oot of their readers
              Em                    D
Ach, there's irony in them thar shelves

As literature goes, but it's a common demonoter
Won't find it in no canon says our Ha Ha Ha Reporter

Here’s another text to ry it’s called Ring of Bright Water
Veracity and edginess, its subject was an otter

Appealing to the masses and the sheltered middle classes
With 11 billion copies in print
It's saccharinely placid it needs a dose of acid
It's given stardom to a man called Grint

And then on social media, you see it spilling over
These weans have dubbed her "queen"! She's a bloody children's author

And she uses her creations for politic-insult-fodder
"Corbyn isn't Dumbledore"- tell me how does that hold water

Don't get me started on the coldly lucre-hearted 
Edinburgh Tourist Gig
Milking JK's chosen dwelling and the bits of storytelling
That she carried out on George IV Bridge

But my worst fears realised: my seven year old daughter
Is starting to ask questions about Harry F8cking Potter

And the second one is this she's impelled me down to Water
Stones and make me pay cash, turn me loyal supporter

And here's the very crux, keep from me your trust
Deliver me your dirty looks
I'm not really qualified to emit this diatribe
Cause I've not seen the films or read the books

Foreboding scene is set, ground is getting wet
See the lightning, clouds and rooks
I'm not really qualified to emit this diatribe
Cause I've not seen the films or read the books

But some things I can't abide: Jimmy Corden, sparkling water
But right up wi The Famous Five...
