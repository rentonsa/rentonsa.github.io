UNPLEASANT DISCHARGE
====================
Written in January 2005. I was determined to write another Pidgin Scots, this time on the subject od war, a tongue-in-cheek response to the state of Iraq; unfortunately I laboured over the lyrics for ages- they work better when they flow out. First time I'd tried anything vaguely political. It's a bit on the nose, probably, but is fairly rich in imagery so just about works. I don't think I'd call it that now- it puts people off before you even start.

Key: A (capo on 2, G shapes)
Unusual chords: C#madd2 - I think- Em shape on 11th fret, with capo on 2
Emaj7 (it isn't this- the shape is Cmaj7 slid up two)

Recordings: David O'Hara

Intro: C#madd2 (ie Em shape on 11th fret, with capo on 2) F#m x2 Dmaj7 Emaj7 (ie Cmaj7 slid up two) F#m Dmaj7 Emaj7

A
I've just got out of hospital,
                               F#m
I'm struggling to open up the door because
A
My arm's bound up in plastercast, 
                                           F#m
There's get well cards a foot high on the floor.
Dmaj7 
And just to prove that life's become one
                        A         F#m
Bilious, backslapping barbecue

We're gonnae hand the George's Cross to you.

I can't say I deserve it much,
But I won't tell the Sun reporters that
They seem to think I liberated millions
And gave their freedom back
No I don't need to tell you I was just a pawn
In one big dirty game
And after all the misery 
These people's lives are really just the same

C#madd2              F#m
Oh it's nice to be home
C#madd2                      F#m
Even though I've not fooled anyone
Dmaj7                Emaj7        F#m
I've done ma bit for the Union Jack
Dmaj7                    Emaj7                       A
And if these wounds heal up they might just send me back.

I sustained ma injuries 
beating up a Private in the mess
He'd not done me any harm, 
I just had tae show him who was best
And later I lay on my bunk
Notching up my vict'ry wi a knife (while ironically)
He died on a dusty road
Trying tae save a local wummin's life

Oh it's nice to be home
Even though I've not fooled anyone
I've done my bit for Unison and Railtrack
And if these wounds heal up they might just send me back.

We had quite a time out there
Throwing our weight around another land
And all we did was justified 
By a stroke of George or Tony's hand
So thanks for all the cards you sent
You guys are really swell
And if I ever get my mental health back
I'll have loads of tales tae tell.

Oh it's nice to be home
Even though I've not fooled anyone
I've put another one in the onion bag
And if these wounds heal up they might just send me back.

with Bruce it used to end:
I really liked this song we wrote
I sang it to my auntie and my uncle
They said you're sounding great
You're sounding just like Simon and Garfunkel (Morecambe and Wise)
The fiddle and the harmonies are working boys
I really like your sound
So write some fucking songs you pricks
And please stop ripping off the Homeward Bound
Write some fucking songs you pricks
And please stop ripping off the Homeward Bound

(excised alternative insecurity rant, 2005)
So as my song comes to an end
I can't wait to read the review
I know the guy that's writing it
Will say it's the best thing he's ever seen me do
Perfect for the Waverley
Quiet, derivative, earnest, cheesy too
Track fourteen on yer fucking disc
Stick it up yer jacksie, CBQ.
