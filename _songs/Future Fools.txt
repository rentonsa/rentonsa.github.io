FUTURE FOOLS
============
Written May 2020. An attempt to write an ecology song- the idea being that if our planet's in such a state, can we all move to another one that can support us- because our complacency has left it as a concern for the next generation. That same migration could be the entire planet retreating into lockdown over Coronavirus, of course. Melodically, it's blatantly influenced by Gene Clark's No Other period- I don't know if that comes across.

Key: Em

Em G D C x2 Em

Em                       C
Brothers sisters foes and lovers
               Am
We caught the train
    G       F           C
The tracks still held together
Em
For the day

Leave a home that's walls are crumbling
Beyond repair
So there wasn't really nothing
To miss there

Em G D C Em

And maybe I'm just too hard-hearted
For others wept
Not stopping us from faling
While they just slept

You couldn't say they hadn't warned us
But we just sat
Said future fools could fret
For fruit like that

              G           G         F     C
I think we've won- the tracks still held together
          G                   G     F     C
Deserving none- there wasn't really nothing
            Am                  G     F   C
They let us come- stopping us from falling
Am
I hope we've not left anyone behind
G    F      C               Em
For future fools to fret was so unkind

I'm sure we saw our spark extinguished
Quite early on
That tiny glistening light
Burnt all we'd known

You got room for 7 billion
The innkeeper's face 
Showed a sort of welcome
Peaceful grace

And I don't have long to endure here
But that's not so
To generations following
And all they'll sow

And if it proves to be disastrous
How do we pay
The future fools who'll fret
For all their days

I think we've won- that tiny glistening light
Deserving none- showed a sort of welcome
They let us come- to generations following
I hope we've not left anyone behind
For future fools to fret was so unkind
