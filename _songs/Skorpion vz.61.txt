SKORPION VZ.61
==============
Written May 08. Last song I wrote while Uhersky Brod were functioning, and appropriately I used Uhersky Brod- the town- as subject matter. Guns are manufactured there, for the uninitiated. We chose to name the EP after the song. Interesting folk fusion with Bruce putting some very trad Scottish fiddle into the Moravian mix.

Recordings: Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod)

Key: Am

Intro: Am G X2

F             C         G         Am  
Fly in yo Vienna, get off the train
F             C         G         Am  
To economic crisis Sigma Olomouc reign
F             C         G         Am  
You think you're nowhere but soon you'll find
F             C         G         Am  
You're in the firing production line

Where the people on the street are of Carpathian stock
And they build CZ2000s with the suicide lock
The handgun's deadly and Komensky looks on
At the lethal Skorpion v61

Em                              F            C
So if a peasant tells you that he armed the Cong
Em                              F            C
We're not here to tell you you're getting it wrong
Em                       F            C
Take the chance to meditate on this prayer
Am                                  G          Am
Everything that you know's gotta start somewhere

Where the farmers are the armers and Babooshka's design
For American policemen and Angolan frontline
And the Cold War peacekeepers agree
Your AK-47s ain't got nothing on these

So if a shepherd tells you that he clad the Bosch
We're not here to tell you you're getting it wrong
Take the chance to meditate on this prayer
Everything that you know's gotta start somewhere

So the next time that you go to the gym with Nike and Reebok
Or you listen to the likes of Mr Sarkozy talk
The same genetic rule applies
World class product humbly supplied

So if a peasant tells you that he armed the Cong
We're not here to tell you you're getting it wrong
Take the chance to meditate on this prayer
Everything that you know's gotta start somewhere
