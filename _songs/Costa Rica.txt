COSTA RICA
==========
Main tune written in August 2001 on a porch in the Estonian countryside. The original words were always a little bit incoherent, not sure what I was trying to say in the spiritual aspect of the song, so I ended up launching into a childhood incident when i broke a window and tore a flag after Scotland lost to Costa Rica in 1990. Used as a vehicle on a number of occasions to 'be topical' (Easter 04, 2005 General Election, Berti Vogts ousting in 2004, Jim Murphy in the 2014 Referendum Campaign (words lost!)). Finally written in 2020, after Claire admitted it was the parochial aspect of it that made it "not one of your best", not the tune. I've just gone for our insignificance there.

Tiny buildings
Tiny windows
Tiny ceilings
Tiny rooms where
Tiny bosses with
Tiny plans make
Tiny drones dance to their tune

Tiny business in
Tiny cities where
Tiny nations fight
Tiny wars cause
Tiny carnage for
Tiny gains
Kept going by a
Tiny star

Your ups and downs
Your pros and cons
Must be dissected, cloned up and plussed
What if I told you
When it's all said and done
You're just no very special
Specks of dust

But our tiny building's
Always on fire
So we can't ever leave it alone
Means we're not minded
To tend the growth
Beyond the confines of our homes

Get to the airways
Get to the jungle
Loosen belts
Sharpen knives
To Costa Rica or Astroiacc
Or will you bumble through your life

[
Found a matchstick, found a saltire
Got the answer here in my head
Take Serghei Dadu, McFadden's hand
And put those nightmares to bed

Don't underestimate, never doubt em
We should know, since Ally's tartan troops
Nearly held Italy, which is better than we'll do
Just one point below us in the group

The ups and downs
The pros and cons
Are you better off without a wife
Just goes to show you gotta realise
As you bumble your way
Through your life

Auf Weidersehen, ich wunsch dich Gluck
Berti Berti, gehst zu Fuck
Auf Weidersehen, ich wunsch dich Gluck
Berti Berti, gehen Sie zu Frankfurt

Strange formations, some brassneck
Thanks for the memories, Mr Vogts

Two Nazarenes, by the wayside
Trying to get an inn to themselves
And they're so caught up
No vacancy
You wonder how they might have felt

As I watch them, from over here
Ask myself would I take their place
Deal with the tension deal with the stress
That comes with parenting the saviour

The ups and downs
The pros and cons
That you get when you're parenting Christ
Just goes to show you gotta compromise
As you bumble your way
Through your life

Found a matchstick, found a saltire
Got the answer here in my head
Build a fire, they'll think it's a star
And bring gold bullion to your bed

Don't underestimate, never doubt em
We should know, since Ally's tartan troops
Vogts, Bonhof, Taylor: the three wise men
Have left us toiling in the group

The ups and downs
The pros and cons
That you get when you're parenting Christ
Just goes to show you gotta realise
As you bumble your way
Through your life

Snow is falling, all around us
Children playing, having fun
It's the season for love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

5/5/5 as 'Costa Recount'

Two young hopefuls went for power
Trying to get the land to themselves
And they're so caught up 
No privacy
You wonder how they might have felt

And as I watch them
From over here
Ask myself
Would I take their place
Deal with the tension
Deal with the stress
That comes with ruling a race

The ups and downs 
The pros and cons
Are you better off without a wife
Just gotta watch the promise wither away
As you bumble your way
Through your life

Found a matchstick
Found a saltire
Got the answer here in my head
Take Alan Milburn, Ken Livingstone
And put those nightmares to bed

Don't underestimate
That deception
If he can send the future to Iraq
Do you think he's bothered
He said he'd let you in
With fingers crossed behind his back?

Start a landslide
Flood to sludge
Too consistent
To be judged 
But as befits a
Preacher's son
Eleven minus ten
Equals one
