COUNT THE COST
==============
Written December 1993. Took about 10 minutes. Quite pleased with the dynamic; words straight from I Watch The Sunrise (not my last plagiarising of a hymn). Think this song fermented the birth of Bullwinkle (somehow I was willing to make a fool of myself singing in the music department when the others weren't); it prompted Stephen Burns to tell the venerable Gerry that "Scott's just written a cracker of a song". Played at all the Bullwinkle gigs before disappearing forever. Attempted to rewrite the fairly insipid lyrics in One More (a paean to Bon Scott), but that didn't quite work out.

Key: D

Recordings: Bullwinkle rehearsal tape somewhere!

Unusual chords: the C is just the C on the B string, everything else open. Therefore, if you hit the D string it becomes a Csus2. Then it's that plus the F on the E, then F# on the E, which may be a Csus4 and a Cb5. Unless you hit the D string.... In those days I had so little idea of structure I came up with far more interesting progressions.

Intro: something going on with a barred 10th fret, then Am G D Am G D

D       
I watch the sunrise
Bm
Start off the day
E7
What's gonna have happened
D
Before it slips away, again

I watch the people
Toiling their way
Why don't they argue
When life's so mundane

C  Csus4 Cb5
Life
    D
So mundane
C  Csus4 Cb5
Life
    D
When you gonna change

Am            Bb    F
And when it's so mundane
Am         G        D
Why do we sit and watch
Am 	          Bb        F
And when nothing ever changes
Am          G      
Why do we act so much
                    D
And why do we count the cost?

I should stop moaning
No right to complain
I'm lucky to be here
Without looking for gain

Listen to me further (father)
Why am I this way?
Gotta realise the value
Before it slips away again

Life
So mundane
Life
When you gonna change

And when it's so mundane
Why do we sit and watch
And when nothing ever changes
Why do we count the cost?
