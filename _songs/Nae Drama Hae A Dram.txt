NAE DRAMA HAE A DRAM
Written effectively on commission in December 05; Kat Hasler notified me of a call for
a songwriter for an adaptation of Billy Connolly's 'And Me Wi A Bad Leg Tae' by Angeline
Ferguson. This rolled out in an hour. Suspect if people realised how much this was a middle
class boy trying to sound earthy I'd get utterly lambasted. Middle eight could age-
not sure what I do when everyone's forgotten Freeview. 

This should be belted out as fast and loud as possible.

Recordings: Jim Sutherland, David O'Hara, Matthew Young (Uhersky Brod), Adam Naylor

Come on son, hae a dram

Come on and let the good times roll
Talk about Johnstone's offside goal
And the unions and that gaping hole
Down which wir pennies seem tae roll
A braw debater, that I am
But if opinions seem tae jam
We'll hae no trouble, jist be calm
Nae drama, hae a dram

Efter that, I'll bet we'll sing
Harry Lauder and a wee bit Bing
Something modern? Got just the thing-
Chuck Berry and his Ding-A-Ling
And when it's time tae go
We get taxis cheap fae the boys we know
And if ye've done the late late show
Jump in the float wi Milkman Joe

So come on and jump the tram
There's babysitters for yer pram
Let yer hair down, yer glesses slam
Nae drama, hae a dram
Nae drama, hae a dram
Nae drama, hae a dram
