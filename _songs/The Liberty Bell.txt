THE LIBERTY BELL
================
Written May/June 2015 initially in Portugal. I didn't feel Jamie Lee was working, but was determined to keep the tune, so came up with these lyrics, which are quite obvious and unimaginative and don't need much explanation. I'm keeping it because of the recording me and Marco did, possibly the only time you'll hear one of these songs delivered as hard rock.


Recordings: Marco Morelli

Key: D


F#m                    G   
Metal physical symbol 
         D
Of everything that's free
F#m                    G   
And guardians of righteous thinking
          D
Would surely all agree
F#m                    G   
That colonialism and empire
         D
Are something to deride
F#m                    G   
And constitutional practice
         D
Is there to be exercised


           A                  Bm
The Liberty Bell- clattering shell 
          G             D
Hollow gold and leaden ties
              A                       Bm
Not mine to tell but it can't ring so well 
      G                D
Got a breach no front can hide


Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war
And where tell me where is that band that so blindingly swore
That the havoc of war is for others and would you resist demands
When the rocket's red glare comes a-calling and the drum is not just the band's


The Liberty Bell- clattering shell 
Hollow gold and leaden ties
Not mine to tell but it can't ring so well 
Got a breach no front can hide

          A                              Bm
Jefferson Franklin Hancock Adams and Lightfoot Lee obviously
            A                            G                   A
Take what you think will fly and send it off to Frank Scott Key

           A              Bm           
Liberty Bell are you ready 
     G               D
To hear it ring tonight
      A                 Bm
Liberty Bell are you ready 
       G              D
For another bloody fight
