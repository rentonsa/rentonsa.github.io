100
===
Written October 1994, just after starting University. This was the 100th song I'd written- see list- and got played live a bit with Bullwinkle, hence its inclusion. Fairly throwaway words, although Matt McAleer contributed the best line, about "bottlecaps of valour", which came from Calvin and Hobbes. Explained above why the order was for 100 of them. Wee harmonica solo over a verse progression towards the end. Bit religious, hadn't noticed that.


Key: C

C             Am               G             Em
I'm packing my bags I've gotta get away
C        
I've made up my mind I'm gonna do it today
F                G        Em
This world feels so assured
F             G              Em
That I feel safe and I feel pure
F                 G                  Em     Am
I guess I'm free and I know that you are


Wouldn't you like to come with me
We'll get in my car and we'll drive off to the sea
And we'll sit there and stare at God's creations
Adore His sun and all His nations
And we'll improve our own relations

D                  Am                C         G
Because I've had 100 bottlecaps of valour tonight
   D                 Am              C               G
That's just about enough for to last us through the night
  F                G              Em
In this world we've got to be brave
     F                  G             Em
It's the only way that we'll get saved
      F             G          Em         Am
So let's just see how we behave
