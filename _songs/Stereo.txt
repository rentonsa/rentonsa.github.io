STEREO
======
Written March 2018. Inspired by then 6 month old Eddie's toy which made a riff that I felt I could build a song round. Just about Claire and me being on the same wavelength and that we both need the same appreciation and responses from people around us. In my head, it needs a falsetto vocal on the verse, with this riff done electronically. Could definitely work with The Heartbreak Diet.


Key: F (capo 5 C shapes)

F  Bb F Bb
You and I
Bb
Weaving different lines
F  Bb F Bb
Low and high
Bb                 F  Bb
Finish the same time
                        F  Bb F Bb
And it's enough to make you cry
Bb
When people don't read signs
                        F Bb  F Bb
We never hit a pitch that high
                   Bb
Weaving different lines

Harmony
Sum the parts we rhyme
Matching key
Tempo, feel and time
A word of praise would mean the world
Acknowledgement'll be fine
All the created notes and words
Sum the parts we rhyme

G    Am Em
Stereo
Layering channels of what's making us tick
Not our role
To be buried in the mix

You and I
Find our frequency
Equalised
KWIT
I hope the message becomes clear
Through all the fuzz you see
Crank up the volume it appears
Found our frequency

Stereo
Layering channels of what's making us tick
Not our role
To be buried in the mix
